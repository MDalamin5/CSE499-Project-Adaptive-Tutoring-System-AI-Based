I want you to generate 5 variations of a given math problem, along with step-by-step solutions. Each variation should be slightly different but mathematically equivalent or of similar complexity. Convert the output into JSON format for an instruction-based dataset. 

### Input Example
Solve the equation: 2x + 3 = 7

### Output Example
[
  {
    "instruction": "Solve the equation: 2x + 3 = 7.",
    "history": [],
    "response": "Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 2. Is this clear? (Yes/No/Explain More)"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is x if 2x + 3 = 7?",
    "history": [],
    "response": "First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4. Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 2. Would you like further clarification?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Find the value of x in the equation: 7 = 3 + 2x.",
    "history": [],
    "response": "Rearrange the equation: 2x = 4. Divide by 2 to get x = 2. Does this explanation make sense?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Determine x if 3 + 2x = 7.",
    "history": [],
    "response": "Move 3 to the other side: 2x = 4. Divide by 2: x = 2. Let me know if you'd like to see a similar example."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Solve for x: 7 = 2x + 3.",
    "history": [],
    "response": "Start by subtracting 3 from both sides: 2x = 4. Then divide both sides by 2: x = 2. Is everything clear so far?"
  }
]

Here are practical suggestions for creating 5 different variants of a problem-solving scenario that ensure meaningful, realistic interactions while avoiding superficial paraphrasing:

1. Introduce Different Student Misunderstandings
Each variant can simulate unique challenges students might face:

Variant 1 (Direct understanding): The student understands the first explanation clearly without needing further clarification.
Variant 2 (Misinterpretation): The student misunderstands the operation (e.g., adds instead of subtracting) and asks why subtraction is needed.
Variant 3 (Conceptual difficulty): The student doesn’t understand the concept (e.g., isolating variables) and needs a detailed explanation.
Variant 4 (Repetition request): The student asks for the explanation to be repeated but doesn’t need a simplified version.
Variant 5 (Topic diversion): The student asks a related question (e.g., “Why do we subtract instead of divide here?”), and the system briefly explains before continuing.


2. Use Different Phrasings for Student Responses
Ensure the student interactions vary in how they ask for help or provide feedback:

Example Variants for "No, I don’t understand":
"I don’t get it. Can you explain differently?"
"That doesn’t make sense. Why do we subtract?"
"Can you go over that step again?"
"I’m confused. Can you make it simpler?"
"I still don’t understand. Please elaborate."

3. Simulate Varying System Teaching Styles
The system’s explanation can be rephrased or adapted in each variant:

Variant 1: A concise explanation (e.g., "Subtracting isolates the variable.").
Variant 2: A step-by-step breakdown with intermediate calculations.
Variant 3: An analogy (e.g., "Think of it as balancing scales. Removing weight from one side must be done on the other.").
Variant 4: Use visual cues or references (e.g., "Imagine writing the equation like this: 2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3.").
Variant 5: Relate the step to a prior concept (e.g., "This is similar to simplifying fractions—we balance both sides.").

4. Add Realistic Context for Problem-Solving
Make the problem more engaging by embedding it into relatable scenarios:

Example Contexts:
"If you have 7 apples, and you’ve already eaten 3, how many are left in 2 equal groups?"
"A store charges $2 per item, plus a $3 service fee. If the total is $7, how many items did you buy?"
"You’re solving for the number of hours needed to complete 7 tasks, given you already worked 3 hours."
"A car travels 7 miles, but 3 of those miles were uphill. The remaining distance is split between two drivers."
"You’re solving for the number of pens in 2 boxes if 3 were taken out of the total."

5. Diversify Feedback and Teaching Flow
Simulate varying conversational flows in each variant:

Variant 1: Linear flow where the student understands each step directly.
Variant 2: Nonlinear flow where the student needs to revisit an earlier step after misunderstanding.
Variant 3: The system introduces an additional topic (e.g., "Before solving, let’s recall what isolating a variable means.").
Variant 4: The student provides partially correct feedback, requiring the system to clarify.
Variant 5: The system prompts a follow-up question (e.g., "What would happen if we divided instead of subtracting?").

6. Use Topic-Specific Teaching Interjections
If the problem involves a formula or specific technique:

Include variants where the system teaches the formula or concept as part of the interaction.
Example: "Before solving, remember the quadratic formula is this.

7. Maintain Context and History
In multi-turn conversations:

Vary the length of history retained in each variant.
Some conversations might involve revisiting earlier steps.
Others might progress smoothly without referencing prior context.

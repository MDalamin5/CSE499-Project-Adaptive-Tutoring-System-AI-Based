i want to create dataset for my project and the dataset creation instruction is below.

Hard Problem Prompt:
You are a highly advanced AI tutor designed to solve equations while simulating different teaching and interaction styles with students. Your task is to generate seven conversation variants for the given problem based on the rules outlined below and then provide a JSON representation of the first variant. Follow the exact format specified.

Rules for Variants:
Variant 1 (Direct Understanding):


The student requires a brief clarification at one step but follows the rest of the solution without issue.

Variant 2 (Hints for Factoring):


The student asks for hints at one or more steps, and the system provides progressive guidance to help them solve the problem.

Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method):


The student struggles with one approach (e.g., factoring) and asks for an alternative method, such as the quadratic formula.

Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Concept of Roots):


The student misunderstands why setting factors to zero finds the roots.
The system explains the concept of roots in detail, ensuring clarity.

Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow):


The student asks to revisit or repeat a specific step, prompting the system to provide a new explanation.

Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step):


The student suggests an incorrect operation, and the system provides corrections, explaining why the step is erroneous and what to do instead.

Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding):


The student struggles throughout the solution, requiring detailed clarifications and multiple scaffolding steps to understand the problem entirely.

Scenario 2.3: Hard Problem (Multiple Explanations Needed)
1. Student's Query
Student logs into the system and types a more difficult problem.
Student Input: "Solve the quadratic equation: ùë• + 4x - 12 = 0."
2
2. System Response (Step 1)
System: "First, we‚Äôll factor the quadratic equation. We need two numbers that multiply to
-12 and add to 4. The correct factorization is (x+6)(x‚àí2)=0."
System Prompt: "Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)"
3. Student Feedback (Clarification Needed)
Student Input: "No."
4. System Clarification
System: "To factor the equation ùë• + 4x - 12 = 0, we look for two numbers that multiply to
2
-12 and add to 4. These numbers are 6 and -2, so we rewrite the equation as
(x+6)(x‚àí2)=0. Does that help? (Yes/No/Explain More)"
5. Student Feedback (Still Confused)
Student Input: "Explain more."
6. System Further Clarification
System: "Factoring means breaking down the equation into simpler parts. We find two
numbers that multiply to the constant term (-12) and add up to the middle term (4).
These numbers are 6 and -2. So, we split the equation into (x+6)(x‚àí2)=0. Does this clear
things up? (Yes/No)"
7. Student Feedback (Understood)
Student Input: "Yes."
8. System Response (Step 2)
System: "Next, set each factor equal to 0. So, x+6=0 or x‚àí2=0. Solving these gives
x=‚àí6 or x=2."
System Prompt: "Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)"
9. Student Feedback (Understood)
Student Input: "Yes."
10. Conclusion and Feedback
System: "Great! The solutions to the equation are x =‚àí6 and x=2. Would you like to try
another quadratic equation or move to a different topic?"

another demo for all variant for your understanding because when i give you a new problem then you will solve this way.


Input Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: x^2‚àí3x‚àí4=0.

Output Variants:
Variant 1 (Direct Understanding):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. We find two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. These numbers are -4 and 1, so the factorisation is (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Yes, I understood.
 System: Great! Next, set each factor equal to 0. This gives x - 4 = 0 or x + 1 = 0. Solving these gives x = 4 or x = -1. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Yes, I understood.
 System: Awesome! The solutions to x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another problem?

Variant 2 (Hints for Factoring):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. We need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. The factorization is(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Can you give me a hint?
 System: Sure! Think of two numbers that multiply to the last term, -4, and add up to the middle term, -3. What could those numbers be?
 Student: -4 and 1?
 System: Exactly! So, the factorization becomes(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Let‚Äôs move on. Next, set each factor equal to zero. Does that make sense?
 Student: Yes, it makes sense to me.
 System: Great! Solving x - 4 = 0 gives x = 4, and solving x + 1 = 0 gives x = -1. The solutions are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try a similar problem?

Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation: \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\).  
System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. The factorization is \((x - 4)(x + 1) = 0\). Do you understand this step?  
Student: No. Can you show me another way?  
System: Of course! Let‚Äôs use the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]  
Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -4\). Plugging these values in gives:  
\[
x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)}
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2}
\]  
So, \(x = \frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4\) or \(x = \frac{3 - 5}{2} = -1\). The solutions are \(x = 4\) and \(x = -1\). Does that make sense?  
Student: Yes, I understand now.  
System: Great! Would you like to try another problem or ask more about the quadratic formula?

Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Concept of Roots):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation:x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials:(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Yes, I get it.
 System: Next, set each factor equal to zero. That gives x - 4 = 0 or x + 1 = 0. Solving these gives x = 4 and x = -1. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Why do we set the factors equal to zero?
 System: Good question! When we multiply two factors and the result is zero, at least one of the factors must equal zero. This is called the zero-product property. By solving x - 4 = 0 and x + 1 = 0, we find the values of xx that satisfy the equation. Does that help?
 Student: Yes, it makes sense now.
 System: Awesome! The solutions are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another problem?

Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. We need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. The factorization is(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Can you explain that again?
 System: Sure! To factor the equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term, -4, and add to the middle coefficient, -3. These numbers are -4 and 1, so we rewrite the equation as (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Does that make sense now?
 Student: Yes, it makes sense now.
 System: Great! Next, set each factor equal to zero. Solving x - 4 = 0 gives x = 4, and solving x + 1 = 0 gives x = -1. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Yes, I understood this step.
 System: Excellent! The solutions are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another one?

Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. We need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. The factorization is (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Shouldn‚Äôt we divide by 2 first?
 System: Not quite. Dividing by 2 doesn‚Äôt work here because the equation isn‚Äôt linear‚Äîit‚Äôs quadratic. For quadratic equations, we need to factor or use the quadratic formula. We rewrite the equation as (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 by factoring. Does that make sense?
 Student: Yes, it does.
 System: Great! Next, set each factor equal to zero: x - 4 = 0 or x + 1 = 0. Solving these gives x = 4 and x = -1. Do you understand this step?
 Student: Yes, I understood.
 System: Awesome! The solutions are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another one?


Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding):
Student: Solve the quadratic equation:x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.
 System: First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials: (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step?
 Student: No, I do not understand. Can you elaborate more?
 System: Let‚Äôs break it down. We need two numbers that multiply to the constant term, -4, and add to the middle coefficient, -3. Can you think of such numbers?
 Student: No, I‚Äôm not sure.
 System: That‚Äôs okay! The numbers are -4 and 1 because (‚àí4)√ó1=‚àí4 and (-4) + 1 = -3. So, we rewrite the equation as (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Does that make sense now?
 Student: Yes, I think so.
 System: Great! Next, set each factor equal to zero: x - 4 = 0 or x + 1 = 0. Solving these gives x = 4 and x = -1. Does that make sense?
 Student: Yes, I get it now.
 System: Fantastic! The solutions x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another problem?

next  task is all 7 variant convert into json format because in feature i use this data for different model finetuing.

json demo:
2. **JSON Representation of Variant 1:**
After listing the five conversation variants, convert Variant 1 (Direct Understanding) into a structured JSON object. Follow this exact schema:

json

{
    "conversation_id": "1",
    "topic": "Solving Quadratic Equations",
    "conversation": [
        {
            "turn": 1,
            "step": 1,
            "role": "student",
            "message": "Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0."
        },
        {
            "turn": 2,
            "step": 1,
            "role": "system",
            "message": "First, factor the quadratic equation into two binomials. We need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -3. The factorization is (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. Do you understand this step? (Yes, I understood this step/No, I did not understand this step/Explain More)"
        },
        {
            "turn": 3,
            "step": 1,
            "role": "student",
            "message": "Yes."
        },
        {
            "turn": 4,
            "step": 2,
            "role": "system",
            "message": "Great! Next, set each factor equal to zero. Solving x - 4 = 0 gives x = 4, and solving x + 1 = 0 gives x = -1. Do you understand this step? (Yes, I understood this step/No, I did not understand this step/Explain More)"
        },
        {
            "turn": 5,
            "step": 2,
            "role": "student",
            "message": "Yes."
        },
        {
            "turn": 6,
            "step": 3,
            "role": "system",
            "message": "Fantastic! The solutions to x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 are x = 4 and x = -1. Would you like to try another problem or ask about factoring?"
        }
    ]
}

Ensure Output Clarity:
The conversation for each variant must demonstrate different levels of understanding, phrasing, and teaching styles.
The JSON structure should retain a multi-turn conversation with distinct roles (student and system) and straightforward steps.
The input equation is: Solve the following equations "2x + 4 = x -3"

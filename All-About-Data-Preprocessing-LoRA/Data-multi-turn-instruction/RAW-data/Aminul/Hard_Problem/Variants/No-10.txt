*** Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(7\) to the terms inside the first parentheses:  
\[
7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14
\]  
Then distribute \(-1\) to the terms inside the second parentheses:  
\[
-(2x + 2) = -2x - 2
\]  
Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
14x + 14 - 2x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms (\(14x - 2x\)) and (\(14 - 2\)):  
\[
12x + 12
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
12x + 12
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Distributing and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(7\). Do you know how to handle \(7(2x + 2)\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(7\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(7 \cdot 2x = 14x\) and \(7 \cdot 2 = 14\). So, \(7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. And what about the \(-(2x + 2)\)?  
**System**: Good question! Distribute \(-1\) to both terms inside the parentheses: \(-1 \cdot 2x = -2x\) and \(-1 \cdot 2 = -2\). So, \(-(2x + 2) = -2x - 2\).  
**Student**: Got it. So now it’s \(14x + 14 - 2x - 2\).  
**System**: Exactly! Combine the \(x\)-terms (\(14x - 2x = 12x\)) and the constants (\(14 - 2 = 12\)). The final expression is \(12x + 12\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: One way is to distribute \(7\) and \(-1\):  
\[
7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14 \quad \text{and} \quad -(2x + 2) = -2x - 2
\]  
Substitute back into the expression:  
\[
14x + 14 - 2x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(12x + 12\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Notice that both terms share \((2x + 2)\), so you can factor it out:  
\[
7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2) = (7 - 1)(2x + 2)
\]  
Simplify \(7 - 1 = 6\), so it becomes:  
\[
6(2x + 2) = 12x + 12
\]



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Distributing)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(7\) across \((2x + 2)\):  
\[
7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14
\]  
Then distribute \(-1\) across \((2x + 2)\):  
\[
-(2x + 2) = -2x - 2
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
14x + 14 - 2x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms (\(14x - 2x = 12x\) and \(14 - 2 = 12\)):  
\[
12x + 12
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \(-(2x + 2)\) give \(-2x - 2\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(-2x + 2\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember that \(-1\) applies to both terms inside the parentheses. So \(-1 \cdot 2x = -2x\) and \(-1 \cdot 2 = -2\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(12x + 12\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(7\) to \((2x + 2)\), giving \(14x + 14\). Then distribute \(-1\) to \((2x + 2)\), giving \(-2x - 2\). Substituting back gives:  
\[
14x + 14 - 2x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(12x + 12\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the distributing step again?  
**System**: Sure! For \(7(2x + 2)\), multiply \(7\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(7 \cdot 2x = 14x\) and \(7 \cdot 2 = 14\). For \(-(2x + 2)\), multiply \(-1\) by each term: \(-1 \cdot 2x = -2x\) and \(-1 \cdot 2 = -2\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(12x + 12\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(7\) and \(-1\):  
\[
7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14 \quad \text{and} \quad -(2x + 2) = -2x - 2
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
14x + 14 - 2x - 2
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we multiply \(7(2x + 2)\) by \(-1\) first?  
**System**: Not quite. Since the subtraction sign only applies to the second term, we distribute \(-1\) only to \((2x + 2)\). After that, combine terms: \(14x - 2x = 12x\) and \(14 - 2 = 12\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So we simplify by combining like terms after distributing?  
**System**: Exactly! The final expression is \(12x + 12\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(7(2x + 2) - (2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, distribute \(7\) across \((2x + 2)\).  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Multiply \(7\) by each term: \(7 \cdot 2x = 14x\) and \(7 \cdot 2 = 14\). So, \(7(2x + 2) = 14x + 14\).  
**Student**: Got it. And what about the \(-(2x + 2)\)?  
**System**: Good question! Distribute \(-1\) to each term: \(-1 \cdot 2x = -2x\) and \(-1 \cdot 2 = -2\). So, \(-(2x + 2) = -2x - 2\).  
**Student**: So now it’s \(14x + 14 - 2x - 2\)?  
**System**: Exactly! Combine the \(x\)-terms (\(14x - 2x = 12x\)) and the constants (\(14 - 2 = 12\)). The simplified expression is \(12x + 12\).  
**Student**: Thanks for explaining step by step!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(12x + 12\).

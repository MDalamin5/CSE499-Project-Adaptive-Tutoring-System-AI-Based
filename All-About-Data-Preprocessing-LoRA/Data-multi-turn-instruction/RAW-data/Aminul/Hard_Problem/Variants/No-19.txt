***Problem**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square.  
1. \((x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\)  
2. \((x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16\)  

Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2 = 3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)
\]  

Distribute the coefficients:  
\[
3(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 3x^2 + 12x + 12
\]  
\[
-(x^2 + 8x + 16) = -x^2 - 8x - 16
\]  

Combine the terms:  
\[
3x^2 + 12x + 12 - x^2 - 8x - 16 = 2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Expansion and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. Do you know how to expand \((x + 2)^2\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = 2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. And \((x + 4)^2\)?  
**System**: Use the same formula with \(a = x\) and \(b = 4\):  
\[
(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]  
**Student**: Got it. So now it’s \(3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)\).  
**System**: Exactly! Distribute the coefficients and combine like terms to simplify:  
\[
3x^2 + 12x + 12 - x^2 - 8x - 16 = 2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: One way is to expand each square first:  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4, \quad (x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]  
Then substitute into the expression:  
\[
3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)
\]  
Distribute and simplify:  
\[
3x^2 + 12x + 12 - x^2 - 8x - 16 = 2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Notice that \((x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\) is a difference of squares. Rewrite it as:  
\[
\big[(x + 2) - (x + 4)\big] \big[(x + 2) + (x + 4)\big]
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
(-2)(2x + 6) = -4x - 12
\]  
Then distribute the 3 and add terms:  
\[
3(-4x - 12) + (-4x - 4) = 2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Formula for Squares)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
And for \((x + 4)^2\):  
\[
(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2 = 3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)
\]  
**Student**: Wait, shouldn’t \((x + 2)^2\) just be \(x^2 + 2\)?  
**System**: Not quite! Remember, \((x + 2)^2\) means \((x + 2)(x + 2)\). When expanded, you must include the cross-term \(4x\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! After substituting and expanding, the final simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 4x - 4\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
And for \((x + 4)^2\):  
\[
(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2 = 3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)
\]  
**Student**: Can you explain how you expanded \((x + 2)^2\)?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). For \((x + 2)^2\), \(a = x\) and \(b = 2\):  
\[
x^2 + 2x(2) + 2^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! Distribute and combine terms to simplify:  
\[
2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
And for \((x + 4)^2\):  
\[
(x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2 = 3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we just add the constants first?  
**System**: Not quite! Each square must be fully expanded first, then you combine terms after distributing. The correct simplification is:  
\[
2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3(x + 2)^2 - (x + 4)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, expand \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
**Student**: I’m not sure how you got that.  
**System**: No problem! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). For \((x + 2)^2\), it becomes \(x^2 + 2x(2) + 2^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**Student**: Got it. What about \((x + 4)^2\)?  
**System**: Similarly, \((x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 2x(4) + 4^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16.\)  
**Student**: So now it’s \(3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 + 8x + 16)\)?  
**System**: Exactly! Distribute and combine terms to simplify:  
\[
2x^2 + 4x - 4
\]  
**Student**: Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 4x - 4\).

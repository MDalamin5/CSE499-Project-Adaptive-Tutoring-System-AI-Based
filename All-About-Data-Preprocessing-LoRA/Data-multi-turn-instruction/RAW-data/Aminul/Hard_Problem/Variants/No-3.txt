** Simplify as much as possible \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding the squared terms. \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\) and \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\). The expression becomes:  
\[
9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Now combine like terms. \(9y^2 - 4y^2 = 5y^2\), so the simplified expression is:  
\[
5y^2 + x^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final answer is \(5y^2 + x^2\).  


#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Combining Like Terms)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: First, expand the squared terms. Do you know how to calculate \((3y)^2\) and \((2y)^2\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! For \((3y)^2\), square both the number and the variable: \(3^2 = 9\), and \(y^2\) stays as \(y^2\), so \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\). Similarly, for \((2y)^2\), \(2^2 = 4\), so \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**System**: That’s right! Now combine the \(y^2\)-terms: \(9y^2 - 4y^2 = 5y^2\). The simplified expression is \(5y^2 + x^2\).  



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: One way is to expand the squared terms: \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\), \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\), so the expression becomes \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\). Then combine \(y^2\)-terms to get \(5y^2 + x^2\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify it?  
**System**: Sure! Think of this as a difference of squares:  
\[
(3y)^2 - (2y)^2 = \left( (3y) + (2y) \right) \cdot \left( (3y) - (2y) \right)
\]  
That simplifies to:  
\[
(5y)(y) = 5y^2
\]  
Then add \(x^2\), giving \(5y^2 + x^2\).  



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Squaring)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: First, expand the squared terms: \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\) and \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\). The expression becomes \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**Student**: Wait, why does \((3y)^2\) become \(9y^2\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(6y\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Squaring \((3y)\) means multiplying \((3y) \times (3y)\). \(3 \times 3 = 9\), and \(y \times y = y^2\). So it’s \(9y^2\), not \(6y\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. So \((2y)^2\) would be \(4y^2\)?  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine \(9y^2 - 4y^2\) to get \(5y^2\), and the final expression is \(5y^2 + x^2\).  



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding the squared terms. \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\) and \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\). So the expression becomes \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the \((3y)^2\) part again? I didn’t quite follow.  
**System**: Sure! \((3y)^2\) means \((3y) \times (3y)\). Multiply \(3 \times 3 = 9\), and \(y \times y = y^2\). That gives \(9y^2\).  
**Student**: Got it! So now it’s \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine \(9y^2 - 4y^2\) to get \(5y^2\). Add \(x^2\), and the final expression is \(5y^2 + x^2\).  



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: Expand the squared terms: \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\), and \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\). The expression becomes \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**Student**: Should we divide by \(y\) to simplify?  
**System**: Not quite! Dividing by \(y\) would change the expression and isn’t allowed unless \(y \neq 0\). Instead, focus on combining like terms. \(9y^2 - 4y^2 = 5y^2\). The final expression is \(5y^2 + x^2\).  



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((3y)^2 + x^2 - (2y)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, expand \((3y)^2\) and \((2y)^2\).  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! For \((3y)^2\), square the coefficient \(3\) to get \(9\), and square \(y\) to get \(y^2\). So \((3y)^2 = 9y^2\). Similarly, \((2y)^2 = 4y^2\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(9y^2 + x^2 - 4y^2\).  
**System**: That’s correct! Now combine \(9y^2 - 4y^2 = 5y^2\). Add \(x^2\), and you get \(5y^2 + x^2\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, thank you for explaining!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(5y^2 + x^2\).

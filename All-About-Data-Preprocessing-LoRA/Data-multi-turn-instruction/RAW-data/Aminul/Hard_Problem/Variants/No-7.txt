***Simplify as much as possible \(4a - 3(a - 3)\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-3\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
Combine like terms (\(4a - 3a\)):  
\[
a + 9
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
a + 9
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Distributing and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-3\). Do you know how to handle \(-3(a - 3)\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(-3\) by both terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3 \cdot a = -3a \quad \text{and} \quad -3 \cdot -3 = 9
\]  
So \(-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(4a - 3a + 9\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the \(a\)-terms: \(4a - 3a = a\). The simplified expression is \(a + 9\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: One way is to distribute \(-3\) to \((a - 3)\):  
\[
-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9
\]  
Then substitute it into the expression:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(a + 9\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Instead of expanding immediately, you could group terms:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
Combine \(4a - 3a = a\), leaving \(a + 9\).  



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Distributing)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-3\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
Combine like terms (\(4a - 3a\)):  
\[
a + 9
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \(-3(a - 3)\) give \(-3a + 9\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(-3a - 3\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember that the \(-3\) applies to both terms inside the parentheses. So \(-3 \cdot -3 = 9\), not \(-3\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(a + 9\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-3\) to \((a - 3)\), giving \(-3a + 9\). Substituting this into the expression gives:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(a + 9\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the distributing step again?  
**System**: Sure! Distributing means multiplying \(-3\) by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3 \cdot a = -3a, \quad -3 \cdot -3 = 9
\]  
So \(-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(a + 9\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-3\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4a - 3a + 9
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we subtract \(3a\) and \(9\) first?  
**System**: Not quite. Subtraction doesn’t happen until after we distribute \(-3\). Distribute first, then combine like terms: \(4a - 3a = a\). The final expression is \(a + 9\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So distribution comes first?  
**System**: Exactly! The final expression is \(a + 9\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(4a - 3(a - 3)\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, distribute \(-3\) to the terms inside the parentheses.  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Multiply \(-3\) by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-3 \cdot a = -3a, \quad -3 \cdot -3 = 9
\]  
So \(-3(a - 3) = -3a + 9\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So now it’s \(4a - 3a + 9\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the like terms: \(4a - 3a = a\). The simplified expression is \(a + 9\).  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(a + 9\).

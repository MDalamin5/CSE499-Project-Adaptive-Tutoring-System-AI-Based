***Simplify as much as possible \(3x - (x + 2)\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x + 2) = -x - 2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms (\(3x - x\)):  
\[
2x - 2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2x - 2
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Distributing and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing the negative sign. Do you know how to handle \(-(x + 2)\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply the negative sign by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x) = -x \quad \text{and} \quad -(2) = -2
\]  
So \(-(x + 2) = -x - 2\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(3x - x - 2\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the \(x\)-terms: \(3x - x = 2x\). The simplified expression is \(2x - 2\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: One way is to distribute the negative sign to \((x + 2)\):  
\[
-(x + 2) = -x - 2
\]  
Then substitute it into the expression:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(2x - 2\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! You could group the terms first:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
Combine \(3x - x = 2x\), leaving \(2x - 2\).  



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Distributing)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x + 2) = -x - 2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms (\(3x - x\)):  
\[
2x - 2
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \(-(x + 2)\) give \(-x - 2\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(-x + 2\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember that the negative sign applies to both terms inside the parentheses. So \(-(x + 2)\) is the same as \(-1 \cdot x + (-1 \cdot 2)\), which equals \(-x - 2\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I get it now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(2x - 2\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing the negative sign to \((x + 2)\), giving \(-x - 2\). Substituting this into the expression gives:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(2x - 2\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the distributing step again?  
**System**: Sure! Distributing means multiplying the negative sign by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x) = -x, \quad -(2) = -2
\]  
So \(-(x + 2) = -x - 2\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(2x - 2\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x + 2) = -x - 2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - x - 2
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add \(x + 2\) first?  
**System**: Not quite. The negative sign outside the parentheses means you need to distribute it before combining terms. Distribute first to get \(-x - 2\), then combine \(3x - x = 2x\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So we handle the negative sign first?  
**System**: Exactly! The final expression is \(2x - 2\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3x - (x + 2)\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses.  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Multiply the negative sign by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x) = -x, \quad -(2) = -2
\]  
So \(-(x + 2) = -x - 2\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So now it’s \(3x - x - 2\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the like terms: \(3x - x = 2x\). The simplified expression is \(2x - 2\).  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(2x - 2\).

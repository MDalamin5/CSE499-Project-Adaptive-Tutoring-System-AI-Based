### **Problem**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \)



#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, expand each squared term:  
- \( (2x)^2 = 4x^2 \)  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute back into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Combine like terms:
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Squaring Terms)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, expand each squared term:  
- \( (2x)^2 = 4x^2 \)  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute back into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Combine like terms:
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why does \( (2x)^2 \) become \( 4x^2 \)?  
**System**: Good question! When you square a term like \( (2x) \), you apply the exponent to both the number and the variable. So, \( (2x)^2 = 2^2 \times x^2 = 4x^2 \). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: Think of squaring like multiplying something by itself. For example, \( (2x)^2 = 2x \times 2x = 4x^2 \). Similarly,  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Combine like terms:
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Does this analogy make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, expand each squared term:  
- \( (2x)^2 = 4x^2 \)  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute back into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Combine like terms:
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \) again?  
**System**: Sure! When you square \( (4x) \), you apply the exponent to both the 4 and the \(x\). This gives \( 4^2 \times x^2 = 16x^2 \). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, expand each squared term:  
- \( (2x)^2 = 4x^2 \)  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute back into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Combine like terms:
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldnâ€™t we square the terms like \( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \)?  
**System**: Not quite! You need to carefully expand each squared term independently and apply the signs given in the original expression. For example, \( (2x)^2 \) is \( 4x^2 \), and when subtracting \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \), the sign affects the combination. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( (2x)^2 - (2y)^2 - (4x)^2 \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. Do you know how to expand \( (2x)^2 \)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! To expand \( (2x)^2 \), you square both the 2 and the \(x\): \( 2^2 \times x^2 = 4x^2 \). Similarly, expand \( (2y)^2 \) and \( (4x)^2 \):  
- \( (2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)  
- \( (4x)^2 = 16x^2 \)  

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
4x^2 - 4y^2 - 16x^2
\]  
Does that hint help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now combine like terms:  
- \( 4x^2 - 16x^2 = -12x^2 \)  
- The \(y^2\)-term remains as \(-4y^2\).  

The final simplified expression is:
\[
-12x^2 - 4y^2
\]

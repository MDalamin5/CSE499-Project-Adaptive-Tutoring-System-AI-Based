### **Problem**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(4\) across \( (x - 1) \):  
\[
4(x) = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad 4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(4\) across \( (x - 1) \):  
\[
4(x) = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad 4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we distribute \(4\) to both \(x\) and \(-1\)?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply \(4\) by every term inside the parentheses. This ensures the expression remains equivalent. So, \(4(x - 1)\) becomes \(4x - 4\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. Think of \(4(x - 1)\) as handing out 4 units to everything inside the parentheses. First, distribute \(4\) to \(x\):  
\[
4(x) = 4x
\]  
Next, distribute \(4\) to \(-1\):  
\[
4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(4\) across \( (x - 1) \):  
\[
4(x) = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad 4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \(x - 4\) is the answer?  
**System**: Sure! After distributing \(4\) and combining the terms, the \(x\)-terms simplify to \(x\), and the \(-4\) remains as it is. Together, this gives \(x - 4\). Does that explanation help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(4\) across \( (x - 1) \):  
\[
4(x) = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad 4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we distribute \(4\) to \(-3x\) as well?  
**System**: Not quite! The \(-3x\) is outside the parentheses, so it isn’t part of the terms being distributed. Only the terms inside \( (x - 1) \) are multiplied by \(4\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4(x - 1) - 3x \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(4\) across \( (x - 1) \). Do you know what \(4(x)\) equals?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(4\) by \(x\):  
\[
4(x) = 4x
\]  
Now, multiply \(4\) by \(-1\):  
\[
4(-1) = -4
\]  
Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
4x - 4 - 3x
\]  
Combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
4x - 3x = x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4

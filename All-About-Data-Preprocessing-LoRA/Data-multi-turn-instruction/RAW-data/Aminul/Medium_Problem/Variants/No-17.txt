### **Problem**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( y \) across \( (2 - y) \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y \quad \text{and} \quad y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Next, distribute the negative sign:  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
y^2 + y
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( y \) across \( (2 - y) \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y \quad \text{and} \quad y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Next, distribute the negative sign:  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we distribute the \( y \) to both \( 2 \) and \(-y\)?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply \( y \) by every term inside the parentheses. This ensures the expression remains equivalent. So \( y(2 - y) \) becomes \( 2y - y^2 \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
y^2 + y
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. Imagine \( y(2 - y) \) as a group where you multiply \( y \) by everything inside. First, distribute \( y \) to \( 2 \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y
\]  
Next, distribute \( y \) to \(-y\):  
\[
y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Now, distribute the negative sign across \( (2y - y^2) \):  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.  
**System**: Great! Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( y \) across \( (2 - y) \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y \quad \text{and} \quad y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Next, distribute the negative sign:  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( -y^2 \) becomes \( +y^2 \)?  
**System**: Sure! When you distribute the negative sign across \( (2y - y^2) \), it changes the sign of each term. So, \( -(-y^2) = +y^2 \). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
y^2 + y
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( y \) across \( (2 - y) \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y \quad \text{and} \quad y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Next, distribute the negative sign:  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we combine \( y \) and \( -y^2 \)?  
**System**: Not quite! \( y \) and \( -y^2 \) are not like terms because they have different powers of \( y \). Like terms must have the same variable and exponent. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
y^2 + y
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3y - y(2 - y) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( y \) across \( (2 - y) \). Do you know what \( y(2) \) equals?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \( y \) by \( 2 \):  
\[
y(2) = 2y
\]  
Now, multiply \( y \) by \(-y\):  
\[
y(-y) = -y^2
\]  
Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
3y - (2y - y^2)
\]  
Distribute the negative sign across \( (2y - y^2) \):  
\[
3y - 2y + y^2
\]  
Combine the \( y \)-terms:  
\[
3y - 2y = y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
y + y^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 + y
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
y^2 + y

### **Problem**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \)



#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x - 3) = -x + 3
\]  
Now, substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x - 3) = -x + 3
\]  
Now, substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we distribute the negative sign?  
**System**: Good question! The subtraction sign in front of the parentheses means you’re subtracting everything inside. Distributing the negative sign changes the signs of each term in the parentheses. For \(x - 3\), distributing gives \(-x + 3\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: Imagine \(x - 3\) as a package of terms, and the negative sign in front means you’re flipping the “signs” of everything in the package. For \(x - 3\), flipping the signs gives \(-x + 3\). Substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]  
Does this analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x - 3) = -x + 3
\]  
Now, substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why the signs change?  
**System**: Sure! When you subtract a group of terms inside parentheses, it’s like multiplying the entire group by \(-1\). For \(x - 3\), multiplying by \(-1\) gives \(-x + 3\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-(x - 3) = -x + 3
\]  
Now, substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we just subtract \(x\) and leave \(3\) alone?  
**System**: Not quite! The subtraction applies to the entire group inside the parentheses. That’s why we distribute the negative sign to both \(x\) and \(-3\), changing the signs to \(-x + 3\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x - (x - 3) \).  
**System**: Do you know how to handle the subtraction sign in front of the parentheses?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! When you subtract a group of terms, distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses. For \(x - 3\), this gives \(-x + 3\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now substitute this into the expression:  
\[
7x - x + 3
\]  
Combine the like terms:
\[
7x - x = 6x
\]  
The final simplified expression is:  
\[
6x + 3
\]

### **Problem**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (3y - 1) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Factoring)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (3y - 1) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we factor out \( (3y - 1) \)?  
**System**: Great question! Factoring allows us to simplify expressions by pulling out common terms. Here, \( (3y - 1) \) appears in both parts of the expression, so we group it together as a common factor. This simplifies the expression to \( (3y - 1)(y - 1) \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Let’s think of \( (3y - 1) \) as a box of items. In the first term, you have \( y \) boxes, and in the second term, you have one box. If you combine these, you end up with \( (y - 1) \) boxes of \( (3y - 1) \). So:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (3y - 1) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why we factor instead of distributing?  
**System**: Sure! While distributing is another approach, factoring is simpler here because \( (3y - 1) \) already appears in both terms. Factoring allows us to pull out the common term directly, leading to \( (3y - 1)(y - 1) \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (3y - 1) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we multiply \( y \) by \( (3y - 1) \) first?  
**System**: Not quite! If we multiply \( y(3y - 1) \), we would expand it to \( 3y^2 - y \), but then we would still need to subtract \( (3y - 1) \). Instead, factoring \( (3y - 1) \) directly is more efficient because it appears in both terms. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (3y - 1) \) is a common factor in both terms. Do you know how to factor it out?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Think of \( (3y - 1) \) as a single term. In the first part, you have \( y \) times \( (3y - 1) \), and in the second part, you subtract \( (3y - 1) \). Factoring it out gives:  
\[
y(3y - 1) - (3y - 1) = (3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
(3y - 1)(y - 1)
\]

### **Problem**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (x - 2) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Factoring)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (x - 2) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we factor out \( (x - 2) \)?  
**System**: Great question! Factoring allows us to simplify the expression by grouping the common terms. Here, \( (x - 2) \) appears in both terms, so we can group it as a single factor multiplied by \( (3 - 1) \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Let’s think of \( (x - 2) \) as a box of items. In the first term, you have 3 boxes, and in the second term, you subtract 1 box. This leaves you with \( (3 - 1) \) boxes of \( (x - 2) \):  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify further:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (x - 2) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify further:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why we factor instead of distributing?  
**System**: Sure! Distributing \( 3(x - 2) \) and subtracting \( (x - 2) \) would work, but it’s less efficient. Factoring allows us to simplify directly by grouping the common \( (x - 2) \) term. This leads to \( (x - 2)(2) \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (x - 2) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify further:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we expand \( 3(x - 2) \) first?  
**System**: Not quite! Expanding \( 3(x - 2) \) would result in \( 3x - 6 \), and then you’d subtract \( (x - 2) \), which is longer. Factoring \( (x - 2) \) directly is more efficient because it’s a common term. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) \).  
**System**: Notice that \( (x - 2) \) is a common factor in both terms. Do you know how to factor it out?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Think of \( (x - 2) \) as a single term. In the first part, you have 3 times \( (x - 2) \), and in the second part, you subtract 1 times \( (x - 2) \). Factoring it out gives:  
\[
3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1)
\]  
Simplify further:  
\[
(x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2)
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
2(x - 2) \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4

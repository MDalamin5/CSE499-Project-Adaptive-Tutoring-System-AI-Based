### **Problem**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
2x - 2x = 0
\]  
Next, combine the \(y\)-terms:  
\[
-7y - 3y = -10y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
2x - 2x = 0
\]  
Next, combine the \(y\)-terms:  
\[
-7y - 3y = -10y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we subtract \(7y\) and \(3y\)?  
**System**: Good question! We subtract because both terms have the same variable (\(y\)) and subtraction is indicated by the negative signs. When we combine them, \(-7y - 3y\) results in \(-10y\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Let’s think of the terms as items. If you have \(2x\) and remove \(2x\), you’re left with 0 \(x\)-terms. Now, think of \(-7y - 3y\) like owing someone 7 dollars and then borrowing 3 more dollars. In total, you owe 10 dollars, which gives \(-10y\). Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.  
**System**: Great! The simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
2x - 2x = 0
\]  
Next, combine the \(y\)-terms:  
\[
-7y - 3y = -10y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain the \(x\)-terms again?  
**System**: Sure! When combining \(2x - 2x\), the positive and negative terms cancel each other out, leaving 0. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now, with the \(y\)-terms combined, the final simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
2x - 2x = 0
\]  
Next, combine the \(y\)-terms:  
\[
-7y - 3y = -10y
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add \(7y\) and \(3y\) since they’re both \(y\)-terms?  
**System**: Not quite! The signs matter here. Since both terms are negative (\(-7y\) and \(-3y\)), we add their absolute values and keep the negative sign, giving \(-10y\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \(2x - 7y - 2x - 3y\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. Do you know how to combine \(2x\) and \(-2x\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Think about canceling terms: \(2x - 2x\) cancels out to 0 because the positive and negative terms balance each other. Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now for the \(y\)-terms, combine \(-7y - 3y\). What do you get?  
**Student**: \(-10y\).  
**System**: Exactly! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-10y
\]

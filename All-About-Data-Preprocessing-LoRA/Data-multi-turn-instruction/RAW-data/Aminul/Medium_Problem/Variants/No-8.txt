### **Problem**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \( \frac{1}{a} \)-terms:  
\[
\frac{3}{a} + \frac{2}{a} = \frac{5}{a}
\]  
Next, combine the \( b \)-terms:  
\[
b + 2b = 3b
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \( \frac{1}{a} \)-terms:  
\[
\frac{3}{a} + \frac{2}{a} = \frac{5}{a}
\]  
Next, combine the \( b \)-terms:  
\[
b + 2b = 3b
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why can we add \( \frac{3}{a} \) and \( \frac{2}{a} \)?  
**System**: Good question! Since both terms have the same denominator (\( a \)), we can add their numerators: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). This gives \( \frac{5}{a} \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Let’s think of the terms as groups. The \( \frac{1}{a} \)-terms are like having 3 pieces of candy divided among \( a \) friends, and then 2 more pieces divided the same way. Together, you have \( \frac{5}{a} \). The \( b \)-terms are like having 1 basket of apples and then adding 2 more baskets. Altogether, you get \( 3b \).  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.  
**System**: Great! The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \( \frac{1}{a} \)-terms:  
\[
\frac{3}{a} + \frac{2}{a} = \frac{5}{a}
\]  
Next, combine the \( b \)-terms:  
\[
b + 2b = 3b
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( b + 2b = 3b \)?  
**System**: Sure! When adding terms with the same variable (\( b \)), you simply add their coefficients. Here, \( 1b + 2b = 3b \). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \( \frac{1}{a} \)-terms:  
\[
\frac{3}{a} + \frac{2}{a} = \frac{5}{a}
\]  
Next, combine the \( b \)-terms:  
\[
b + 2b = 3b
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we combine \( \frac{3}{a} \) with \( b \) since they’re all terms?  
**System**: Not quite! \( \frac{3}{a} \) and \( b \) are not like terms because they don’t share the same variable or structure. Only terms with the same variable and form can be combined. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{3}{a} + b + \frac{2}{a} + 2b \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. Do you know how to combine \( \frac{3}{a} \) and \( \frac{2}{a} \)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Focus on the denominators. Both terms have the same denominator (\( a \)), so you add the numerators: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). This gives \( \frac{5}{a} \). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now combine \( b + 2b = 3b \). The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{5}{a} + 3b
\]

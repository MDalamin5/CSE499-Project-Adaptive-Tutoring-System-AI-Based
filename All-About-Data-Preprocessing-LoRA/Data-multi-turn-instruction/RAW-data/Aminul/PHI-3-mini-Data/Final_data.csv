Simplify x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
First, combine like terms x^3 and -2x^3 to get -x^3. That yields -x^3 + 7x^2. Then, factor out x^2 to get x^2(7 - x). Do you understand this step? (Yes, I understood this step/No, I did not understand this step/Explain More)
<|end|>

<|user|>
I'm a bit confused about how x^3 and -2x^3 become -x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
We add their coefficients: 1 + (-2) = -1, so x^3 + -2x^3 = -x^3. Does that clarify?
<|end|>

<|user|>
Yes, that makes sense now.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Great! The simplified expression is x^2(7 - x). Good work! Would you like to try another problem?

Simplify x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
We can tackle this by first combining like terms. Do you have any idea which terms are alike?
<|end|>

<|user|>
I'm not sure; can I get a hint?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Of course! Look at x^3 and -2x^3. When you add them, what do you get?
<|end|>

<|user|>
x^3 plus -2x^3 is -x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Exactly! So the expression becomes -x^3 + 7x^2. Now, what is the greatest common factor in both terms?
<|end|>

<|user|>
They both share x^2.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Perfect! Factoring out x^2 gives x^2(7 - x). That’s our simplified expression.

First, combine like terms x^3 and -2x^3 to get -x^3. That leaves -x^3 + 7x^2. Then we can factor out x^2, giving x^2(7 - x). Do you understand this approach?
<|end|>

<|user|>
I’m not really understanding the factoring part. Is there another way?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Sure! Another approach is to reorder the expression as (x^3 - 2x^3) + 7x^2 = -x^3 + 7x^2. From there, notice that each term has x^2. Does that help clarify the factoring?

<|end|>

<|user|>
Wait, why are we allowed to just add x^3 and -2x^3? Aren’t they different terms?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
They’re actually like terms because they both have x^3. We add or subtract their coefficients: 1 + (-2) = -1. That’s why x^3 + -2x^3 = -x^3. Does that make sense?

We can approach this by carefully expanding the first term. Do you know how to expand (2x)^2?
<|end|>

<|user|>
I’m not totally sure; maybe it’s 2x^2?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Remember that (2x)^2 = (2x)*(2x). Try multiplying the numbers and the variables separately.
<|end|>

<|user|>
So 2 × 2 = 4, and x × x = x^2. That means (2x)^2 = 4x^2.

One way is to expand (2x)^2 to 4x^2, then subtract 2x^2, yielding 2x^2. Would you like an alternative method?
<|end|>

<|user|>
Yes, I'd like to see another way.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
We can also factor out 2x^2 directly. (2x)^2 is 4x^2, so think of it as 2x^2( something ) - 2x^2( 1 ).
<|end|>

<|user|>
So (2x)^2 = 4x^2, which is 2x^2 * 2. And -2x^2 is 2x^2 * -1.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Exactly! Inside the parentheses, you end up with 2 - 1 = 1. Multiply by 2x^2 and you get 2x^2 again.

That won’t simplify as effectively. We want to handle the exponent properly by expanding (2x)^2. Once expanded, we just combine like terms.

Sure! You could treat (3y)^2 - (2y)^2 as a difference of squares: ((3y) + (2y)) * ((3y) - (2y)). This simplifies to (5y) * (y) = 5y^2. Then add x^2, giving 5y^2 + x^2.

Simplify 3x(x - 1) - 7x^2.

Start by expanding 3x(x - 1): 3x(x - 1) = 3x^2 - 3x. Substituting this gives 3x^2 - 3x - 7x^2.

Shouldn’t we divide everything by x first?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Not quite. Dividing by x simplifies if x ≠ 0, but here it’s better to expand and combine terms first. Expanding gives 3x^2 - 3x - 7x^2 = -4x^2 - 3x.

<|user|>

Yes! Instead of distributing immediately, notice that (2x + 2) is a common factor. You can write this as (7 - 1)(2x + 2).

Simplify (7 - 1) = 6, so it becomes 6(2x + 2) = 12x + 12.

Not quite. You can’t combine 7 and -1 directly because they multiply different terms. First, distribute each separately: 7 * (2x + 2) = 14x + 14 and -1 * (2x + 2) = -2x - 2.

Not quite! Remember, (2x + 1)^2 means (2x + 1)(2x + 1). When expanded, you must include the cross-term 4x.

Not quite! If we multiply y(3y - 1), we would expand it to 3y^2 - y, but then we would still need to subtract (3y - 1). Instead, factoring (3y - 1) directly is more efficient because it appears in both terms. Does that make sense?

Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply the term outside the parentheses by each term inside. For 7b(a + 2), distribute 7b to both a and 2, resulting in 7ab + 14b. Similarly, for a(3b + 3), distribute a to both 3b and 3, resulting in 3ab + 3a. Does that help?

Why do we multiply each term by every other term?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Good question! This is called the distributive property, which ensures that every term in the first set of parentheses is multiplied by every term in the second set. It’s the same as finding the product of two numbers by splitting them into parts. Does that make sense?

Think of this as distributing each term in (3x + 4) to every term in (x - 2). First, multiply 3x by x and -2, then multiply 4 by x and -2. This gives: 3x^2 - 6x + 4x - 8. Combine like terms: 3x^2 - 2x - 8. The simplified expression is: 3x^2 - 2x - 8. Does that analogy help?

To simplify, use the distributive property. Multiply each term in (3x + 4) by each term in (x - 2):
3x * x = 3x^2,
3x * -2 = -6x,
4 * x = 4x,

<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Sure! Both -6x and 4x are like terms because they have the same variable, x, raised to the same power. When we combine them, we add their coefficients: -6 + 4 = -2. That’s why the result is -2x. Does that make sense now?

Sure! Start by multiplying 3b by 2a and then by 5b. Next, multiply -a by 2a and then by 5b. This gives: 6ab + 15b^2 - 2a^2 - 5ab. Combine like terms: 6ab - 5ab becomes ab. The final simplified expression is: -2a^2 + ab + 15b^2. Does that help?

First, simplify (y - 2)(y + 3) using the distributive property. Multiply each term in (y - 2) by each term in (y + 3):
y * y = y^2,
y * 3 = 3y,
-2 * y = -2y,
-2 * 3 = -6.
Combine these: y^2 + y - 6.
Now, multiply the result by 3y: 3y(y^2 + y - 6) = 3y^3 + 3y^2 - 18y.
The simplified expression is: 3y^3 + 3y^2 - 18y. Do you understand this step?

Correct! Now, multiply x by 2 to get 2x, then multiply 2 by x to get 2x, and finally, multiply 2 by 2 to get 4. Combine all terms: x² + 2x + 2x + 4 simplifies to x² + 4x + 4. The simplified expression is: x² + 4x + 4. Does that help?

To simplify (x - 2)², expand it as (x - 2)(x - 2). Use the distributive property (FOIL method): Multiply x by x to get x², x by -2 to get -2x, -2 by x to get -2x, and -2 by -2 to get 4.

To simplify (2x + y)², expand it as (2x + y)(2x + y). Use the distributive property (FOIL method): Multiply 2x by 2x to get 4x², 2x by y to get 2xy, y by 2x to get 2xy, and y by y to get y².

Remove the brackets and simplify (3 - x)².
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Let's use the formula for a squared binomial: (A - B)² = A² - 2AB + B². Here, A = 3 and B = x.
<|end|>

<|user|>
So we get 9 - 2(3)(x) + x²?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Exactly! Simplifying further: x² - 6x + 9.

Remove the brackets and simplify (a - 2b)².
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
To simplify (a - 2b)², expand it as (a - 2b)(a - 2b). Use the distributive property (FOIL method): Multiply a by a to get a², a by -2b to get -2ab, -2b by a to get -2ab, and -2b by -2b to get 4b². Combine all the terms: a² - 2ab - 2ab + 4b² simplifies to a² - 4ab + 4b². The simplified expression is: a² - 4ab + 4b². Do you understand this step?

<|user|>
Yes, I understood.

Why do we multiply a and -2b twice?
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Good question! When expanding (a - 2b)(a - 2b), we use the distributive property. Each term in the first bracket (a and -2b) is multiplied by each term in the second bracket (a and -2b). This ensures all possible products are included. Does that make sense?
<|end|>

<|user|>
Yes, it does.

<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Let’s expand (a - 2b)² by writing it as (a - 2b)(a - 2b). First, multiply a by a to get a², then a by -2b to get -2ab. Next, multiply -2b by a to get -2ab, and -2b by -2b to get 4b². Combine all the terms: a² - 2ab - 2ab + 4b² simplifies to a² - 4ab + 4b². The simplified expression is: a² - 4ab + 4b². Does this approach make sense?

Can you try expanding (a - 2b)(a - 2b) yourself? Think of the distributive property.

<|user|>
I'm not sure.

No problem! Multiply a by a to get a², a by -2b to get -2ab, -2b by a to get -2ab, and -2b by -2b to get 4b². Combine all the terms: a² - 2ab - 2ab + 4b² simplifies to a² - 4ab + 4b².

<|assistant|>
Should we distribute the exponent first?
<|end|>

<|user|>
Yes, we should square a and -2b separately.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
Not quite! When squaring a binomial, we expand the full expression: (a - 2b)(a - 2b). That includes cross terms like -2ab. Now, does that make sense?

Yes, I understand now.

Let's use the formula for a squared binomial: (A - B)² = A² - 2AB + B². Here, A = a and B = 2b.

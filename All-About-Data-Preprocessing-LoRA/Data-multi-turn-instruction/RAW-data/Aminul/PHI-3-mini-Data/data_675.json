First, multiply a by a to get a\u00b2, then a by -2b to get -2ab. Next, multiply -2b by a to get -2ab, and -2b by -2b to get 4b\u00b2. Combine all the terms: a\u00b2 - 2ab - 2ab + 4b\u00b2 simplifies to a\u00b2 - 4ab + 4b\u00b2. The simplified expression is: a\u00b2 - 4ab + 4b\u00b2. Does this approach make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, it helped.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! Would you like to try another problem?\n<|end|>"

Think of the distributive property.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nI'm not sure.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNo problem! Multiply a by a to get a\u00b2, a by -2b to get -2ab, -2b by a to get -2ab, and -2b by -2b to get 4b\u00b2. Combine all the terms: a\u00b2 - 2ab - 2ab + 4b\u00b2 simplifies to a\u00b2 - 4ab + 4b\u00b2.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nThat makes sense now!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat!

When squaring a binomial, we expand the full expression: (a - 2b)(a - 2b). That includes cross terms like -2ab. Now, does that make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I understand now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nExcellent! The correct simplified expression is: a\u00b2 - 4ab + 4b\u00b2.\n<|end|>"

Here, A = a and B = 2b.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nSo we get a\u00b2 - 2(a)(2b) + (2b)\u00b2?\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nExactly! Simplifying further: a\u00b2 - 4ab + 4b\u00b2.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nThat was easy!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nAwesome! Want to try another problem?\n<|end|>"

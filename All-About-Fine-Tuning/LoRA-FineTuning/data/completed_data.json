Distribute the -2 across (x - 1): -2 * x = -2x and -2 * -1 = 2. On the right-hand side, distribute the 3 across (2x - 1): 3 * 2x = 6x and 3 * -1 = -3. This gives: 7 - 2x + 2 = 6x - 3 + 2.

Distribute the 6 across (3x - 4): 6 * 3x = 18x and 6 * -4 = -24. Distribute the -10 across (x - 3): -10 * x = -10x and -10 * -3 = 30. Distribute the 10 across (2x - 3): 10 * 2x = 20x and 10 * -3 = -30. This gives: 18x - 24 - 10x + 30 = 20x - 30. Do you understand this step? (Yes\/No\/Explain More)\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, simplify the terms on the left-hand side. Combine the x terms: 18x - 10x = 8x. Combine the constants: -24 + 30 = 6.

Distribute the 2 across (x + 5): 2 * x = 2x and 2 * 5 = 10. The left-hand side becomes: 5 + 2x + 10. On the right-hand side, distribute the negative sign across (4 - 5x): -1 * 4 = -4 and -1 * -5x = +5x. The right-hand side becomes: 10 - 4 + 5x. The equation is now: 5 + 2x + 10 = 10 - 4 + 5x. Do you understand this step? (Yes\/No\/Explain More)\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, simplify both sides. On the left-hand side: 5 + 10 = 15, so it becomes: 2x + 15.

(Yes\/No\/Explain More)\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNow, move all terms involving x to one side and constants to the other. Subtract 2x from both sides: 15 = 6 + 3x.

To distribute, multiply the number outside the parentheses by each term inside. For example, 30 * x = 30x and 30 * -12 = -360. Similarly, for 2(x - 1 1\/2), multiply 2 * x = 2x and 2 * -1 1\/2 = -3.

Move the 2x term to the left side by subtracting 2x: 36x - 2x = 34x. Then add 360 to both sides to move the constant: 34x = 357. Are you ready to solve for x?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, please finish this.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nFinally, divide both sides by 34 to isolate x: x = 357 \/ 34 = 10.5. That\u2019s the solution!

I forgot to move the constant properly.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNo problem! Now, solve for x by dividing both sides by 34: x = 357 \/ 34 = 10.5.

Do you understand this step?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, let\u2019s move on.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, subtract 3 from both sides: ( 4 - 3 = 4x ), which simplifies to ( 1 = 4x ). Finally, divide both sides by 4: ( x = 1\/4 ). Does this make sense now?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I understand. Thanks!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nYou\u2019re welcome! The solution is ( x = 1\/4 ).

On the left-hand side, expand (2x - 1)(x - 3): Multiply 2x by (x - 3) to get 2x^2 - 6x, and multiply -1 by (x - 3) to get -x + 3. Combine terms to get 2x^2 - 7x + 3.

So, -(2x + 2) = -2x - 2.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nOh, so now it\u2019s 14x + 14 - 2x - 2?\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nExactly! Combine the x-terms (14x - 2x = 12x) and the constants (14 - 2 = 12).

Use the formula (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2. For (x - 3)^2: x^2 - 2(x)(3) + 3^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nOh, I see. Thanks!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat!

The LCD here is 2x: (-2\/x) = (-4\/2x), (1\/2) = (x\/2x). Combine the fractions: (-4\/2x) + (x\/2x) = (x - 4)\/2x. The simplified expression is (x - 4)\/2x.

Do you know how to factor it out?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nNot sure, can I get a hint?\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nSure! Think of (x - 2) as a single term. In the first part, you have 3 times (x - 2), and in the second part, you subtract 1 times (x - 2). Factoring it out gives: 3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)(3 - 1). Simplify further: (x - 2)(3 - 1) = (x - 2)(2). The simplified expression is: 2(x - 2) or 2x - 4. Does that help?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, it does.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! The final simplified expression is: 2(x - 2) or 2x - 4. Would you like to try another problem?\n<|end|>"

First, multiply x by x to get x\u00b2, then x by 2 to get 2x. Next, multiply 2 by x to get 2x, and 2 by 2 to get 4. Combine all the terms: x\u00b2 + 2x + 2x + 4 simplifies to x\u00b2 + 4x + 4. Now, multiply this result by 3: 3(x\u00b2 + 4x + 4) = 3x\u00b2 + 12x + 12. The simplified expression is: 3x\u00b2 + 12x + 12.

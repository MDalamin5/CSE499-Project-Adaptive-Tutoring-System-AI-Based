Solve this problem step by step.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nSolve the equation: x² + 3x = (x + 3)(x + 1).\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nFirst, expand the right-hand side of the equation. Multiply  (x + 3)(x + 1) :  x * x = x² ,  x * 1 = x ,  3 * x = 3x , and  3 * 1 = 3 . Adding these together gives  x² + 4x + 3 . The equation becomes  x² + 3x = x² + 4x + 3 . Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I understand.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nNext, subtract  x²  from both sides:  3x = 4x + 3 . Subtract  4x  from both sides:  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 . Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nFinally, divide both sides by  -1 :  x = -3 . The solution is  x = -3 .

Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nCan you give me a hint for expanding?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nSure! To expand  (x + 3)(x + 1) , use the distributive property (FOIL): First, multiply  x * x = x² , then  x * 1 = x , then  3 * x = 3x , and finally  3 * 1 = 3 . Add these together to get  x² + 4x + 3 . Does this help?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I understand now.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat! After expanding, the equation becomes  x² + 3x = x² + 4x + 3 . Subtract  x²  from both sides to simplify:  3x = 4x + 3 . Subtract  4x :  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 . Do you follow this step?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I do.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nFinally, divide by  -1 :  x = -3 . Does this solution make sense?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, it does now.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nPerfect! The solution is  x = -3 .

Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nCan we solve this without expanding?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGood question! Expanding makes it easier to combine like terms. Without it, isolating  x  would be difficult. Would you like to continue with expanding?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nOkay, let’s expand.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat! After expanding, the equation becomes  x² + 3x = x² + 4x + 3 . Subtract  x²  from both sides:  3x = 4x + 3 . Subtract  4x :  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 .

Since  x²  appears on both sides of the equation, subtracting it simplifies the equation by removing  x²  entirely. This leaves  3x = 4x + 3 , which is easier to solve. Does this explanation help?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I understand now.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat!

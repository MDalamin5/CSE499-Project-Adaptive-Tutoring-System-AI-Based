Solve this problem step by step.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nSolve the equation: x² + 3x = (x + 3)(x + 1).\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nFirst, expand the right-hand side by multiplying  (x + 3)(x + 1) :  x * x = x² ,  x * 1 = x ,  3 * x = 3x , and  3 * 1 = 3 . Adding these together gives  x² + 4x + 3 . The equation becomes  x² + 3x = x² + 4x + 3 . Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nCan you explain the multiplication  x * x  again?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nSure! When multiplying  x * x , the result is  x² , because you add the exponents (1 + 1 = 2). Does this explanation help?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I understand now.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat! After expanding, subtract  x²  from both sides. The equation becomes  3x = 4x + 3 . Subtract  4x :  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 . Are you following so far?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, I understand.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nFinally, divide both sides by  -1 :  x = -3 . The solution is  x = -3 . Let me know if you'd like to try another problem!\n<|im_end|>\n"

Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nI think the equation simplifies to  x² + 3 = 4x .\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nNot quite. After expanding the right-hand side, the correct simplification is  x² + 3x = x² + 4x + 3 . Subtract  x²  from both sides, leaving  3x = 4x + 3 . Let’s proceed from here.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nOh, I see now. Let’s continue.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat! Subtract  4x  from both sides:  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 . Divide both sides by  -1 :  x = -3 .

Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nNo, I don’t get how you got  3x  and  x .\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nNo problem! When expanding  (x + 3)(x + 1) , multiply each term in  x + 3  by each term in  x + 1 . First,  x * x = x² , then  x * 1 = x . Next,  3 * x = 3x , and finally  3 * 1 = 3 . Adding these together gives  x² + 4x + 3 . Does that make sense?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, that helps.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nGreat! After expanding, subtract  x²  from both sides. The equation becomes  3x = 4x + 3 . Are you ready to proceed?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user<|im_sep|>\nYes, let’s continue.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant<|im_sep|>\nNext, subtract  4x  from both sides:  3x - 4x = 3 , which simplifies to  -x = 3 .

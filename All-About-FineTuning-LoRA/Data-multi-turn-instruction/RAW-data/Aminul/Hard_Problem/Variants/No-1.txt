 
**"Simplify as much as possible \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\)."**  



### Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: First, combine the like terms \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\). This gives \(-x^3\), so the expression becomes \(-x^3 + 7x^2\). Then, factor out the greatest common factor, \(x^2\). We have:  
\[
-x^3 + 7x^2 = x^2(-x + 7) = x^2(7 - x).
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: I’m a bit confused about why \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) become \(-x^3\).  
**System**: Good question! We’re effectively adding the coefficients: \(1 + (-2) = -1\). So \(x^3 + (-2x^3) = (-1)x^3 = -x^3\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, that clears it up.  
**System**: Great! The simplified expression is \(x^2(7 - x)\). Nice job!



### Variant 2 (Hints for Factoring)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: We can tackle this by first combining like terms and then factoring out the greatest common factor. Do you have any idea what the like terms might be?  
**Student**: I’m not entirely sure; can I get a hint?  
**System**: Of course! Look at the terms \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\). When you combine them, what do you get?  
**Student**: I guess \(x^3 + -2x^3 = -x^3\).  
**System**: Exactly! So we have \(-x^3 + 7x^2\). Now, what is the greatest common factor here?  
**Student**: Both terms have \(x^2\).  
**System**: Perfect! Factoring out \(x^2\) leaves \(x^2( -x + 7 )\), or \(x^2(7 - x)\). That’s the simplified form!



### Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: First, combine the like terms \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) to get \(-x^3\). Now the expression is \(-x^3 + 7x^2\). We can factor out \(x^2\), giving \(x^2(7 - x)\).  
**Student**: I’m not seeing how the factoring step works. Is there another way?  
**System**: Sure! Another approach is to reorder and group terms clearly:  
\[
x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3 = (x^3 - 2x^3) + 7x^2 = -x^3 + 7x^2.
\]  
Then notice each term has \(x^2\). That means we can factor out \(x^2\) to get  
\[
x^2(-x + 7).
\]  
Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, that’s clearer. Thanks!  
**System**: Wonderful. The simplified form is \(x^2(7 - x)\).



### Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Concept of Combining Like Terms)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: Let’s start by combining the like terms \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\), which gives \(-x^3\). So the expression becomes \(-x^3 + 7x^2\). Then we factor out \(x^2\) to get \(x^2(7 - x)\).  
**Student**: Wait, why can we add \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\)? Aren’t they different?  
**System**: Great question! They’re actually the same type of term because both are \(x^3\). We just add or subtract their coefficients. Here, \(1 + (-2) = -1\), so \(x^3 - 2x^3 = -x^3\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see! So that’s allowed because they’re both \(x^3\).  
**System**: Exactly. Once we have \(-x^3 + 7x^2\), we factor out \(x^2\) to simplify further.



### Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: Start by combining the like terms. \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) add up to \(-x^3\), so we get \(-x^3 + 7x^2\). Then, factor out \(x^2\) to arrive at \(x^2(7 - x)\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the combining of \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) again? I want to make sure I follow.  
**System**: Certainly! Think of \(x^3\) as \(1x^3\). Adding \(1x^3\) to \(-2x^3\) is like \(1 + (-2)\), which equals \(-1\). That’s why you end up with \(-x^3\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the fully simplified expression is \(x^2(7 - x)\).



### Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: Let’s first combine \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) to get \(-x^3\). So we have \(-x^3 + 7x^2\).  
**Student**: Maybe we should factor out \(x^3\) now?  
**System**: That’s a common mistake. Notice that \(7x^2\) doesn’t contain \(x^3\) as a factor, so you can’t pull out \(x^3\) from both terms. Instead, look for the greatest common factor, which is \(x^2\).  
**Student**: Right, because \(-x^3\) = \(-x^2 \cdot x\) and \(7x^2\) = \(x^2 \cdot 7\).  
**System**: Exactly! So factoring out \(x^2\) gives \(x^2(-x + 7)\), or \(x^2(7 - x)\). That’s our simplified result.



### Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)

**Student**: Simplify \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, identify and combine any like terms. Here, \(x^3\) and \(-2x^3\) are like terms.  
**Student**: I’m not sure I see why.  
**System**: Because they both have \(x^3\). We just add the coefficients: \(1 + (-2) = -1\). So those terms combine to \(-x^3\). That makes our expression \(-x^3 + 7x^2\).  
**Student**: Okay, I understand that now.  
**System**: Great! Next, notice both terms share \(x^2\). That means we can factor \(x^2\) out:  
\[
-x^3 + 7x^2 = x^2(-x + 7).
\]  
We often reorder it as \(x^2(7 - x)\). Do you see how that works?  
**Student**: Yes, that helps a lot.  
**System**: Excellent! That’s the simplified form.

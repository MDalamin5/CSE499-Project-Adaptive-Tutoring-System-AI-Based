*** Remove the brackets and simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each squared term. First, expand \((x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]  
Next, expand \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Add the expanded results:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Combine like terms:  
\[
2x^2 + 6x + 5
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
2x^2 + 6x + 5
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Expanding and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s start by expanding \((x + 1)^2\). Do you know how to expand it?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = 1\). So \((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. And for \((x + 2)^2\)?  
**System**: Similarly, \((x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**Student**: Got it. So it’s \(x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine like terms: \(x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2\), \(2x + 4x = 6x\), and \(1 + 4 = 5\). The simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: One way is to expand \((x + 1)^2\) and \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1, \quad (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Then add the results:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x^2 + 6x + 5
\]  
**Student**: Is there another way to approach this?  
**System**: Sure! You can think of \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\) as grouping squares of terms. Expand directly using the formula for squares of sums:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Then proceed to simplify. Both approaches give \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Expansion)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding \((x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]  
Next, expand \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Add the expanded results:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Combine like terms:  
\[
2x^2 + 6x + 5
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \((x + 1)^2\) become \(x^2 + 2x + 1\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(x^2 + 1\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember, \((x + 1)^2 = (x + 1) \cdot (x + 1)\). When you expand it, you multiply each term:  
\[
x \cdot x = x^2, \quad x \cdot 1 = x, \quad 1 \cdot x = x, \quad 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]  
Adding these gives \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding \((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\) and \((x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\). Adding these gives:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).  
**Student**: Can you explain \((x + 2)^2\) again?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). For \((x + 2)^2\), \(a = x\) and \(b = 2\):  
\[
a^2 = x^2, \quad 2ab = 2 \cdot x \cdot 2 = 4x, \quad b^2 = 2^2 = 4
\]  
Adding these gives \(x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding \((x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]  
Next, expand \((x + 2)^2\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Add the expanded results:  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we just add the terms inside the parentheses first?  
**System**: Not quite. You can’t add terms inside the parentheses because they are squared separately. You must expand each square individually, then combine the results. Does that clarify?  
**Student**: Oh, I see. Thanks!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, expand \((x + 1)^2\).  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to expand that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). For \((x + 1)^2\), \(a = x\) and \(b = 1\):  
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1
\]  
**Student**: Got it. And for \((x + 2)^2\)?  
**System**: Similarly, \((x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So now it’s \(x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4\).  
**System**: Exactly! Combine the like terms: \(x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2\), \(2x + 4x = 6x\), and \(1 + 4 = 5\). The final expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).  
**Student**: Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(2x^2 + 6x + 5\).

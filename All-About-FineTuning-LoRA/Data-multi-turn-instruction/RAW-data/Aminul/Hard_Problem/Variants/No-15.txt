*** Remove the brackets and simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: This is a difference of squares problem. Use the formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\).  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
Simplify the first factor:  
\[
(x + 2) - (x - 3) = 5
\]  
Simplify the second factor:  
\[
(x + 2) + (x - 3) = 2x - 1
\]  
Multiply the factors:  
\[
5 \cdot (2x - 1) = 10x - 5
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
10x - 5
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Applying Difference of Squares)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s start by identifying that this is a difference of squares. Do you know the formula for \(a^2 - b^2\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you remind me?  
**System**: Sure! The formula is \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\).  
Apply the formula:  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. How do we simplify \((x + 2) - (x - 3)\)?  
**System**: Subtract the terms: \((x + 2) - (x - 3) = x + 2 - x + 3 = 5\).  
**Student**: Got it. And for \((x + 2) + (x - 3)\)?  
**System**: Add the terms: \((x + 2) + (x - 3) = x + 2 + x - 3 = 2x - 1\).  
Now multiply the factors:  
\[
5 \cdot (2x - 1) = 10x - 5
\]  
The simplified expression is \(10x - 5\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: One way is to use the difference of squares formula:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
Simplify each factor:  
\[
(x + 2) - (x - 3) = 5, \quad (x + 2) + (x - 3) = 2x - 1
\]  
Multiply the factors:  
\[
5 \cdot (2x - 1) = 10x - 5
\]  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Yes, you could expand each square individually, but it’s longer. Expand \((x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\) and \((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\). Subtract the second from the first:  
\[
(x^2 + 4x + 4) - (x^2 - 6x + 9)
\]  
Combine terms: \(x^2 - x^2 + 4x + 6x + 4 - 9 = 10x - 5\). Both methods give the same result.



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Difference of Squares)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: This is a difference of squares problem. Use the formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\) become this? Shouldn’t we just expand both squares?  
**System**: You could expand both, but the difference of squares formula is faster. It works because \(a^2 - b^2\) always factors into \((a - b)(a + b)\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(10x - 5\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by using the difference of squares formula:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
Simplify the first factor:  
\[
(x + 2) - (x - 3) = 5
\]  
Simplify the second factor:  
\[
(x + 2) + (x - 3) = 2x - 1
\]  
Multiply the factors:  
\[
5 \cdot (2x - 1) = 10x - 5
\]  
**Student**: Can you explain the \((x + 2) - (x - 3)\) step again?  
**System**: Sure! Subtracting \((x - 3)\) means reversing the sign:  
\[
(x + 2) - (x - 3) = x + 2 - x + 3 = 5
\]  
Does that clarify?  
**Student**: Yes, thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(10x - 5\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by using the difference of squares formula:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\):  
\[
(x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = [(x + 2) - (x - 3)] \cdot [(x + 2) + (x - 3)]
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we just expand the terms first?  
**System**: Not necessarily. Expanding works, but the difference of squares formula is faster. For example, expanding \((x + 2)^2\) and \((x - 3)^2\) separately takes longer than factoring directly. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(10x - 5\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((x + 2)^2 - (x - 3)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, recognize this as a difference of squares:  
\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]  
Here, \(a = (x + 2)\) and \(b = (x - 3)\).  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to apply that.  
**System**: No problem! Use the formula. Subtract \((x - 3)\) from \((x + 2)\):  
\[
(x + 2) - (x - 3) = x + 2 - x + 3 = 5
\]  
Add \((x + 2)\) and \((x - 3)\):  
\[
(x + 2) + (x - 3) = x + 2 + x - 3 = 2x - 1
\]  
Multiply the results:  
\[
5 \cdot (2x - 1) = 10x - 5
\]  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(10x - 5\).

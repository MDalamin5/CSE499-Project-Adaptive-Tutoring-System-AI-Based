***Problem**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square:  
1. \((2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1\)  
2. \((x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9\)  

Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
(2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2 = (4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  

Expand using the distributive property:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Expansion and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. Do you know how to expand \((2x + 1)^2\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). Here, \(a = 2x\) and \(b = 1\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. And \((x + 3)^2\)?  
**System**: Use the same formula with \(a = x\) and \(b = 3\):  
\[
(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Got it. So now it’s \((4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)\).  
**System**: Exactly! Multiply each term of the first factor by each term of the second factor and combine like terms to get:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: One way is to expand each square first:  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1, \quad (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9
\]  
Then substitute into the expression:  
\[
(4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  
Expand and combine like terms:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Rewrite the expression as \(((2x + 1)(x + 3))^2\). First, expand \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\):  
\[
2x^2 + 7x + 3
\]  
Then square the result:  
\[
(2x^2 + 7x + 3)^2 = 4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]  
The result is the same.



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Formula for Squares)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((2x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
And for \((x + 3)^2\):  
\[
(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
(2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2 = (4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  
**Student**: Wait, shouldn’t \((2x + 1)^2\) just be \(4x^2 + 1\)?  
**System**: Not quite! Remember, \((2x + 1)^2\) means \((2x + 1)(2x + 1)\). When expanded, you must include the cross-term \(4x\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! After substituting and expanding, the final simplified expression is \(4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((2x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
And for \((x + 3)^2\):  
\[
(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
(2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2 = (4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  
**Student**: Can you explain how to multiply these terms again?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply each term of the first factor by each term of the second factor:  
\[
4x^2(x^2 + 6x + 9), \, 4x(x^2 + 6x + 9), \, 1(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  
Combine terms to get:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks!



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \((2x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
And for \((x + 3)^2\):  
\[
(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
(4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add the terms in the squares first?  
**System**: Not quite. Each square must be expanded fully before multiplying. Once expanded, use the distributive property to combine terms. The final simplified expression is \(4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \((2x + 1)^2(x + 3)^2\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, expand \((2x + 1)^2\):  
\[
(2x + 1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
**Student**: I’m not sure how you got that.  
**System**: No problem! Use the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). For \((2x + 1)^2\), \(a = 2x\) and \(b = 1\):  
\[
4x^2 + 2(2x)(1) + 1^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. What about \((x + 3)^2\)?  
**System**: Use the same formula: \((x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 2x(3) + 3^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9\).  
**Student**: Got it. So now it’s \((4x^2 + 4x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 9)\).  
**System**: Exactly! Multiply each term of the first factor by each term of the second factor and combine like terms to simplify:  
\[
4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(4x^4 + 28x^3 + 61x^2 + 42x + 9\).

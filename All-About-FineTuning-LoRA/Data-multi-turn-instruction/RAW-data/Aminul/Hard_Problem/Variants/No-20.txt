***Problem**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square.  
1. \( (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 \)  
2. Multiply this by 2: \( 2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18 \)  
3. \( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \)  
4. Multiply this by -3: \( -3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3 \).  

Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 = (2x^2 - 12x + 18) + (-3x^2 - 6x - 3)
\]  

Combine like terms:  
\[
2x^2 - 3x^2 = -x^2,\quad -12x - 6x = -18x,\quad 18 - 3 = 15
\]  

The simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 - 18x + 15
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Expansion and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. Do you know how to expand \( (x - 3)^2 \)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Use the formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \). Here, \( a = x \) and \( b = 3 \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Multiply this by 2:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. And \( (x + 1)^2 \)?  
**System**: Use the same formula with \( b = 1 \):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
Multiply this by -3:  
\[
-3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3
\]  
**Student**: Got it. What’s next?  
**System**: Combine the terms:  
\[
2x^2 - 3x^2 = -x^2,\quad -12x - 6x = -18x,\quad 18 - 3 = 15
\]
The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 - 18x + 15
\]



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: One way is to expand each square first:  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9, \quad (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]  
Multiply these by their respective coefficients:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18, \quad -3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3
\]  
Then substitute into the expression:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 = (2x^2 - 12x + 18) + (-3x^2 - 6x - 3)
\]  
Combine like terms to simplify:  
\[
-x^2 - 18x + 15
\]  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! You could group the coefficients directly and factorize step by step, but expanding and combining terms is the most straightforward approach.



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Formula for Squares)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Multiply this by 2:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18
\]  
And for \( (x + 1)^2 \):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
Multiply this by -3:  
\[
-3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3
\]  
**Student**: Wait, shouldn’t \( (x - 3)^2 \) just be \( x^2 - 9 \)?  
**System**: Not quite! Remember, \( (x - 3)^2 \) means \( (x - 3)(x - 3) \). When expanded, you must include the cross-term \( -6x \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! After substituting and combining terms, the final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 - 18x + 15
\]



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Multiply this by 2:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18
\]  
And for \( (x + 1)^2 \):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
Multiply this by -3:  
\[
-3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3
\]  
**Student**: Can you explain how to combine the terms again?  
**System**: Sure! Add the \( x^2 \)-terms: \( 2x^2 - 3x^2 = -x^2 \). Then the \( x \)-terms: \( -12x - 6x = -18x \). Finally, the constants: \( 18 - 3 = 15 \).  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( -x^2 - 18x + 15 \).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Start by expanding each square. For \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Multiply this by 2:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18
\]  
And for \( (x + 1)^2 \):  
\[
(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
Multiply this by -3:  
\[
-3(x + 1)^2 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we combine \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \) directly first?  
**System**: Not quite. You must first expand each square and apply the coefficients before combining terms. The final simplified expression is \( -x^2 - 18x + 15 \).


#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 2(x - 3)^2 - 3(x + 1)^2 \).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, expand \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Multiply this by 2:  
\[
2(x - 3)^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 18
\]  
**Student**: I’m not sure how you got that.  
**System**: No problem! Use the formula \( (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \). For \( (x - 3)^2 \):  
\[
x^2 - 2(x)(3) + 3^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]  
**Student**: Oh, I see. What about \( (x + 1)^2 \)?  
**System**: Similarly, \( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \). Multiply this by -3 to get \( -3x^2 - 6x - 3 \).  
**Student**: So now we combine terms?  
**System**: Exactly! Combine \( x^2 \)-terms, \( x \)-terms, and constants:  
\[
-x^2 - 18x + 15
\]  
**Student**: Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \( -x^2 - 18x + 15 \).

*** Simplify as much as possible \(3a + 2(a + 4)\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
2(a + 4) = 2a + 8
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
3a + 2a + 8
\]  
Combine like terms (\(3a + 2a\)):  
\[
5a + 8
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
5a + 8
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Distributing and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(2\). Do you know how to handle \(2(a + 4)\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(2\) by both terms inside the parentheses: \(2 \cdot a = 2a\) and \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\). So \(2(a + 4) = 2a + 8\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(3a + 2a + 8\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the \(a\)-terms: \(3a + 2a = 5a\). The simplified expression is \(5a + 8\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: One way is to distribute \(2\) to \(a + 4\):  
\[
2(a + 4) = 2a + 8
\]  
Then substitute it into the expression:  
\[
3a + 2a + 8
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(5a + 8\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Instead of expanding immediately, you could group terms:  
\[
3a + 2(a + 4) = (3a + 2a) + 8
\]  
Combine \(3a + 2a = 5a\), leaving \(5a + 8\).



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Distributing)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
2(a + 4) = 2a + 8
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
3a + 2a + 8
\]  
Combine like terms (\(3a + 2a\)):  
\[
5a + 8
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \(2(a + 4)\) give \(2a + 8\)? Shouldn’t it be \(2a + 4\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember that the \(2\) applies to both terms inside the parentheses. \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\), not \(4\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(5a + 8\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(2\) to \(a + 4\), giving \(2a + 8\). Substituting this into the expression gives:  
\[
3a + 2a + 8
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(5a + 8\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the distributing step again?  
**System**: Sure! Distributing means multiplying \(2\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(2 \cdot a = 2a\) and \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\). So \(2(a + 4) = 2a + 8\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(5a + 8\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
2(a + 4) = 2a + 8
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
3a + 2a + 8
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we multiply \(3a\) by \(2\) first?  
**System**: Not quite. \(3a\) isn’t multiplied by \(2\) because it’s separate from the parentheses. We only distribute \(2\) to \(a + 4\). After that, you add the terms \(3a + 2a = 5a\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So we don’t multiply \(3a\) by \(2\)?  
**System**: Exactly! The final expression is \(5a + 8\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(3a + 2(a + 4)\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, distribute \(2\) to the terms inside the parentheses.  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Multiply \(2\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(2 \cdot a = 2a\) and \(2 \cdot 4 = 8\). So \(2(a + 4) = 2a + 8\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So now it’s \(3a + 2a + 8\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the like terms: \(3a + 2a = 5a\). The simplified expression is \(5a + 8\).  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(5a + 8\).

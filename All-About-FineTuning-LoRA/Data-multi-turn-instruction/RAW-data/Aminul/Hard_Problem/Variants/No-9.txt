***Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4
\]  
Substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
5x - 4x - 4
\]  
Combine like terms (\(5x - 4x\)):  
\[
x - 4
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I got it.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
x - 4
\]



#### **Variant 2 (Hints for Distributing and Combining)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-2\). Do you know how to handle \(-2(2x + 2)\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can you give me a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(-2\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(-2 \cdot 2x = -4x\) and \(-2 \cdot 2 = -4\). So \(-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So it’s \(5x - 4x - 4\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the \(x\)-terms: \(5x - 4x = x\). The simplified expression is \(x - 4\).



#### **Variant 3 (Request for Alternative Method)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: One way is to distribute \(-2\) across \((2x + 2)\):  
\[
-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4
\]  
Substitute this back into the expression:  
\[
5x - 4x - 4
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(x - 4\).  
**Student**: Is there another way to simplify this?  
**System**: Sure! Instead of expanding immediately, you could group terms:  
\[
5x - 2(2x + 2) = 5x - 4x - 4.
\]  
Then combine \(5x - 4x = x\), leaving \(x - 4\).



#### **Variant 4 (Misunderstanding Distributing)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
5x - 4x - 4
\]  
Combine like terms (\(5x - 4x\)):  
\[
x - 4
\]  
**Student**: Wait, why does \(-2(2x + 2)\) give \(-4x - 4\)? Shouldn’t it just be \(-4x + 2\)?  
**System**: That’s a good question! Remember that \(-2\) applies to both terms inside the parentheses. \(-2 \cdot 2x = -4x\), and \(-2 \cdot 2 = -4\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \(x - 4\).



#### **Variant 5 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-2\) to \(2x + 2\), giving \(-4x - 4\). Substituting this back into the expression gives:  
\[
5x - 4x - 4
\]  
Combine like terms to get \(x - 4\).  
**Student**: Can you explain the distributing step again?  
**System**: Sure! Distributing means multiplying \(-2\) by each term inside the parentheses: \(-2 \cdot 2x = -4x\) and \(-2 \cdot 2 = -4\). So \(-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4\).  
**Student**: Got it. That makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! So the simplified expression is \(x - 4\).



#### **Variant 6 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Start by distributing \(-2\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4
\]  
Substituting this gives:  
\[
5x - 4x - 4
\]  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we divide \(5x\) by \(2\) first?  
**System**: Not quite. Dividing by \(2\) isn’t the correct step here because the order of operations means we handle the parentheses and distribution first. After expanding, you combine \(5x - 4x\), which gives \(x - 4\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So we simplify by combining \(x\)-terms first?  
**System**: Exactly! The final expression is \(x - 4\).



#### **Variant 7 (Multiple Explanations and Scaffolding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x - 2(2x + 2)\).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, distribute \(-2\) to the terms inside the parentheses.  
**Student**: I’m not sure how to do that.  
**System**: That’s okay! Multiply \(-2\) by each term in the parentheses: \(-2 \cdot 2x = -4x\) and \(-2 \cdot 2 = -4\). So \(-2(2x + 2) = -4x - 4\).  
**Student**: Oh, I see. So now it’s \(5x - 4x - 4\).  
**System**: Exactly! Now combine the like terms: \(5x - 4x = x\). The simplified expression is \(x - 4\).  
**Student**: Got it. Thanks for explaining!  
**System**: You’re welcome! The final simplified expression is \(x - 4\).

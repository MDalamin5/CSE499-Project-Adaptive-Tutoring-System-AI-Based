### **Problem**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\)

#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(y\)-terms: \(2y - 4y = -2y\). The expression becomes:  
\[
5x - 2y - x^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(y\)-terms: \(2y - 4y = -2y\). The expression becomes:  
\[
5x - 2y - x^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we subtract \(2y\) and \(4y\)?  
**System**: Good question! Subtraction is needed because the signs indicate opposite operations: \(+2y\) and \(-4y\). Subtracting gives \(-2y\), which simplifies the \(y\)-terms. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now the final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, let’s deal with the \(y\)-terms. Think of \(2y\) and \(-4y\) like adding and subtracting apples. If you have 2 apples and remove 4 apples, you’re left with \(-2\) apples, or \(-2y\). Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! The expression now becomes:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(y\)-terms: \(2y - 4y = -2y\). The expression becomes:  
\[
5x - 2y - x^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain that again?  
**System**: Sure! When combining \(2y\) and \(-4y\), we subtract the coefficients because one is positive and the other is negative. This gives \(-2y\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, I understand.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(y\)-terms: \(2y - 4y = -2y\). The expression becomes:  
\[
5x - 2y - x^2
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add \(2y\) and \(-4y\) instead of subtracting?  
**System**: Not quite! Adding isn’t correct because the signs are different. Instead, we subtract \(4y\) from \(2y\) because \(4y\) has a negative sign. This gives \(-2y\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \(5x + 2y - 4y - x^2\).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the \(y\)-terms. Do you know how to combine \(2y\) and \(-4y\)?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Focus on the coefficients: \(2\) and \(-4\). Subtract them to get \(-2\), and keep the variable \(y\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The expression now becomes:  
\[
-x^2 + 5x - 2y
\]

### **Problem**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \):  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( x^2 \)-terms:  
\[
-7x^2 - 4x^2 = -11x^2
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \):  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( x^2 \)-terms:  
\[
-7x^2 - 4x^2 = -11x^2
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we add the coefficients of \( -7x^2 \) and \( -4x^2 \)?  
**System**: Good question! When combining like terms, you add or subtract their coefficients. Since both terms have \( x^2 \), you add the coefficients:  
\[
-7 - 4 = -11
\]  
This gives \( -11x^2 \). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \):  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
This is like squaring the number 2 and multiplying it by \( x^2 \). Substitute it back into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Now, think of the \( x^2 \)-terms as a group of items. You start with \(-7x^2\), and you subtract \( 4x^2 \), leaving \(-11x^2\). The \( 5x \)-term remains separate because it’s a different kind of term.  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.  
**System**: Great! Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \):  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( x^2 \)-terms:  
\[
-7x^2 - 4x^2 = -11x^2
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( 5x \) isn’t combined with the other terms?  
**System**: Sure! The \( 5x \)-term can’t be combined with the \( x^2 \)-terms because they’re not like terms. Like terms must have the same variable raised to the same power. Since \( 5x \) is raised to the power of 1 and the others are raised to the power of 2, they remain separate. Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \):  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Now, combine the \( x^2 \)-terms:  
\[
-7x^2 - 4x^2 = -11x^2
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add \( 5x \) and \( -7x^2 \)?  
**System**: Not quite! The terms \( 5x \) and \( -7x^2 \) can’t be combined because they’re not like terms. Like terms must have the same variable raised to the same power. Since \( x \) and \( x^2 \) have different exponents, they remain separate. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 5x - 7x^2 - (2x)^2 \).  
**System**: First, simplify \( (2x)^2 \). Do you know what \( (2x)^2 \) equals?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! \( (2x)^2 \) means squaring both 2 and \( x \). So:  
\[
(2x)^2 = 4x^2
\]  
Now substitute this into the expression:  
\[
5x - 7x^2 - 4x^2
\]  
Combine the \( x^2 \)-terms:  
\[
-7x^2 - 4x^2 = -11x^2
\]  
The \( 5x \)-term remains separate. The simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-11x^2 + 5x
\]

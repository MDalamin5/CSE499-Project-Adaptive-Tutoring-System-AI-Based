### **Problem**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2\) to each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(3x - 1) = -6x + 2
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
9 + 2 - 6x = 11 - 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2\) to each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(3x - 1) = -6x + 2
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
9 + 2 - 6x = 11 - 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why does \(-2\) multiply both terms inside the parentheses?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property states that when you multiply a number by a group inside parentheses, you multiply it by each term inside. For \(-2(3x - 1)\), \(-2\) is multiplied by \(3x\) and by \(-1\), giving \(-6x + 2\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: Imagine distributing \(-2\) is like handing out \(-2\) items to each term inside the parentheses. For \(3x\), you give \(-2 \times 3x = -6x\). For \(-1\), you give \(-2 \times -1 = 2\). This makes the expression:  
\[
9 - 6x + 2
\]  
Now, combine the constants:  
\[
9 + 2 = 11
\]  
So the simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]  
Does that analogy make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2\) to each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(3x - 1) = -6x + 2
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
9 + 2 - 6x = 11 - 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain the distribution step again?  
**System**: Sure! To distribute \(-2\) to \(3x - 1\), multiply \(-2\) by each term inside:  
\[
-2 \times 3x = -6x \quad \text{and} \quad -2 \times -1 = 2
\]  
This gives \(-6x + 2\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2\) to each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2(3x - 1) = -6x + 2
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
9 + 2 - 6x = 11 - 6x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldnâ€™t we just subtract \(2\) from \(9\) instead of distributing?  
**System**: Not quite! The subtraction applies to the entire parentheses, not just the \(2\). This is why we distribute \(-2\) to both terms inside. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 9 - 2(3x - 1) \).  
**System**: Do you know how to distribute \(-2\) to the terms inside the parentheses?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(-2\) by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2 \times 3x = -6x \quad \text{and} \quad -2 \times -1 = 2
\]  
This gives \(-6x + 2\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now combine the constants:  
\[
9 + 2 = 11
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
11 - 6x
\]

### **Problem**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-4\) across \( (2x + 5) \):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x \quad \text{and} \quad -4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-4\) across \( (2x + 5) \):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x \quad \text{and} \quad -4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we distribute \(-4\) to both \(2x\) and \(5\)?  
**System**: Good question! When you have a term like \(-4(2x + 5)\), the distributive property tells us to multiply \(-4\) by each term inside the parentheses. This ensures the expression stays equivalent. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: Let’s think of \( 4(2x + 5) \) as a group. Distributing \(-4\) is like handing out a penalty to everyone in the group. First, distribute \(-4\) to \(2x\):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x
\]  
Next, distribute \(-4\) to \(5\):  
\[
-4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, it helped.

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-4\) across \( (2x + 5) \):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x \quad \text{and} \quad -4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( -4 \) is distributed to both terms?  
**System**: Sure! The distributive property ensures that \(-4\) is multiplied by every term inside the parentheses. For \( (2x + 5) \), this means multiplying \(-4\) by \(2x\) and by \(5\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-4\) across \( (2x + 5) \):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x \quad \text{and} \quad -4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Now, combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we distribute \(4\) instead of \(-4\)?  
**System**: Not quite! Since the term outside the parentheses is \(-4\), you must distribute the negative sign along with the 4. That’s why both \(2x\) and \(5\) are multiplied by \(-4\), not \(4\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3x - 4(2x + 5) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-4\) across \( (2x + 5) \). Do you know what \(-4(2x)\) equals?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(-4\) by \(2x\):  
\[
-4(2x) = -8x
\]  
Now, multiply \(-4\) by \(5\):  
\[
-4(5) = -20
\]  
Substitute these into the expression:  
\[
3x - 8x - 20
\]  
Combine the \(x\)-terms:  
\[
3x - 8x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
-5x - 20

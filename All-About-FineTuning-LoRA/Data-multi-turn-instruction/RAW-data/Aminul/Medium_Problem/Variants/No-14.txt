### **Problem**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( 3x \) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
3x(x - 4) = 3x^2 - 12x
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
7x - 12x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( 3x \) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
3x(x - 4) = 3x^2 - 12x
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
7x - 12x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we multiply \( 3x \) by both terms inside the parentheses?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply \( 3x \) by each term inside the parentheses. For \( 3x(x - 4) \), multiply \( 3x \) by \( x \) to get \( 3x^2 \), and then multiply \( 3x \) by \(-4\) to get \(-12x\). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: Imagine the distributive property as sharing a group. For \( 3x(x - 4) \), think of \( 3x \) as a group that needs to be distributed to both \( x \) and \(-4\). Multiply \( 3x \times x = 3x^2 \) and \( 3x \times -4 = -12x \). Now the expression becomes:  
\[
7x + 3x^2 - 12x
\]  
Combine the like terms \( 7x - 12x \):  
\[
-5x
\]  
The final expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]  
Does this analogy make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( 3x \) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
3x(x - 4) = 3x^2 - 12x
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
7x - 12x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain the distribution step again?  
**System**: Sure! To distribute \( 3x \), multiply it by each term inside the parentheses:  
- \( 3x \times x = 3x^2 \)  
- \( 3x \times -4 = -12x \)  
This gives \( 3x^2 - 12x \). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \( 3x \) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
3x(x - 4) = 3x^2 - 12x
\]  
Now, combine like terms:  
\[
7x - 12x = -5x
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldnâ€™t we add \( 7x \) and \( 3x^2 \) directly?  
**System**: Not quite! \( 7x \) and \( 3x^2 \) are not like terms because they have different exponents. Only terms with the same variable and exponent can be combined. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7x + 3x(x - 4) \).  
**System**: Do you know how to distribute \( 3x \) to the terms inside the parentheses?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \( 3x \) by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
3x \times x = 3x^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 3x \times -4 = -12x
\]  
This gives \( 3x^2 - 12x \). Does that hint help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now combine the like terms:  
\[
7x - 12x = -5x
\]  
The final simplified expression is:  
\[
3x^2 - 5x
\]

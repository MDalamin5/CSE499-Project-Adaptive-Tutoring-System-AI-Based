### **Problem**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2a\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2a(b - 2) = -2ab + 4a
\]  
Now, substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2a\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2a(b - 2) = -2ab + 4a
\]  
Now, substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why does \(-2a\) multiply both \(b\) and \(-2\)?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply the term outside the parentheses by each term inside. So, \(-2a(b - 2)\) means multiplying \(-2a\) by \(b\) to get \(-2ab\), and multiplying \(-2a\) by \(-2\) to get \(+4a\). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: Imagine distributing \(-2a\) is like handing out \(-2a\) items to both parts inside the parentheses. For \(b\), you give \(-2a \times b = -2ab\). For \(-2\), you give \(-2a \times -2 = 4a\).  
Now substitute these into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The final expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]  
Does this analogy make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2a\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2a(b - 2) = -2ab + 4a
\]  
Now, substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain the distribution step again?  
**System**: Sure! To distribute \(-2a\), multiply it by each term inside the parentheses:  
- \(-2a \times b = -2ab\)  
- \(-2a \times -2 = 4a\)  
This gives \(-2ab + 4a\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: First, distribute \(-2a\) to the terms inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2a(b - 2) = -2ab + 4a
\]  
Now, substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldnâ€™t we combine \(3ab\) and \(4a\) directly?  
**System**: Not quite! \(3ab\) and \(4a\) are not like terms because they have different variables and structures. Like terms must have the same variable(s) and exponent(s). Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 3ab - 2a(b - 2) \).  
**System**: Do you know how to distribute \(-2a\) to the terms inside the parentheses?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Multiply \(-2a\) by each term inside the parentheses:  
\[
-2a \times b = -2ab \quad \text{and} \quad -2a \times -2 = 4a
\]  
This gives \(-2ab + 4a\). Does that hint help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now substitute this into the expression:  
\[
3ab - 2ab + 4a
\]  
Combine the like terms:
\[
3ab - 2ab = ab
\]  
The final simplified expression is:  
\[
ab + 4a
\]

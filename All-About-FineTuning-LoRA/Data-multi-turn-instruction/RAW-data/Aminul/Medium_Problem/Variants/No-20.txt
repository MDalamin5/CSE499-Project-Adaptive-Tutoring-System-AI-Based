### **Problem**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \)



#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute each term:
- \( 7b(a + 2) = 7ab + 14b \)
- \( a(3b + 3) = 3ab + 3a \)

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Distribution)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute each term:
- \( 7b(a + 2) = 7ab + 14b \)
- \( a(3b + 3) = 3ab + 3a \)

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we distribute \( 7b \) and \( a \)?  
**System**: Good question! The distributive property tells us to multiply the term outside the parentheses by each term inside. For \( 7b(a + 2) \), you distribute \( 7b \) to both \( a \) and \( 2 \), resulting in \( 7ab + 14b \). Similarly, for \( a(3b + 3) \), you distribute \( a \) to \( 3b \) and \( 3 \), resulting in \( 3ab + 3a \). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: Think of the distributive property like distributing items to two groups. For \( 7b(a + 2) \), distribute \( 7b \) to \( a \) and \( 2 \):  
\[
7b \times a = 7ab \quad \text{and} \quad 7b \times 2 = 14b
\]  
For \( a(3b + 3) \), distribute \( a \) to \( 3b \) and \( 3 \):  
\[
a \times 3b = 3ab \quad \text{and} \quad a \times 3 = 3a
\]  
Now substitute these back:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

Does this analogy make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute each term:
- \( 7b(a + 2) = 7ab + 14b \)
- \( a(3b + 3) = 3ab + 3a \)

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why we subtract \( 3ab \) from \( 7ab \)?  
**System**: Sure! The subtraction sign applies to the entire group inside the parentheses. So, when removing the parentheses, \( 3ab \) becomes \(-3ab\), and it combines with \( 7ab \). This gives \( 7ab - 3ab = 4ab \). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: First, distribute each term:
- \( 7b(a + 2) = 7ab + 14b \)
- \( a(3b + 3) = 3ab + 3a \)

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we combine \( 14b \) and \( 3a \) since they’re constants?  
**System**: Not quite! While both are constants, \( 14b \) involves the variable \( b \), and \( 3a \) involves the variable \( a \). Only terms with the same variable can be combined. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 7b(a + 2) - a(3b + 3) \).  
**System**: Do you know how to distribute the terms outside the parentheses?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! For \( 7b(a + 2) \), distribute \( 7b \) to both \( a \) and \( 2 \). This gives \( 7ab + 14b \). For \( a(3b + 3) \), distribute \( a \) to both \( 3b \) and \( 3 \). This gives \( 3ab + 3a \). Substitute these back into the expression:
\[
(7ab + 14b) - (3ab + 3a)
\]

Does that hint help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! Now remove the parentheses and combine like terms:
\[
7ab - 3ab = 4ab
\]
The terms \( 14b \) and \(-3a\) remain as they are. The final simplified expression is:
\[
4ab + 14b - 3a
\]

### **Problem**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \)



#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) has no like terms, so it remains as it is. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) remains as it does not have any like terms. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why can we combine \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) but not \( 3a^2 \)?  
**System**: Good question! In algebra, like terms have the same variable and the same exponent. \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) are like terms because they both have the variable \( a \) with an exponent of 1. \( 3a^2 \) is not a like term because it has a different exponent (2). Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it makes sense now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) remains as it does not have any like terms. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Not really.  
**System**: Imagine you are sorting apples and oranges. The terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) are like apples—they can be combined. But \( 3a^2 \) is like an orange—it’s a different type and can’t be combined with the apples. So we add \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) to get \( 2a \), and \( 3a^2 \) stays as it is. Does that analogy help?  
**Student**: Yes, that makes sense.  
**System**: Great! The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) remains as it does not have any like terms. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why \( 3a^2 \) can’t be combined with the others again?  
**System**: Sure! Like terms must have the same variable and the same exponent. Here, \( 3a^2 \) has the variable \( a \) but with an exponent of 2, while \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) have an exponent of 1. This difference means they are not like terms, so \( 3a^2 \) stays separate. Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) remains as it does not have any like terms. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we add \( 4a \) and \( 3a^2 \) together?  
**System**: Not quite. The terms \( 4a \) and \( 3a^2 \) are not like terms because they have different exponents. Only like terms—terms with the same variable and exponent—can be combined. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now. Thanks!  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?



#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( 4a + 3a^2 - 2a \).  
**System**: Combine the like terms \( 4a \) and \( -2a \). This gives \( 2a \). The term \( 3a^2 \) remains as it does not have any like terms. The simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! To simplify, look for terms with the same variable and exponent. \( 4a \) and \( -2a \) both have the variable \( a \) with an exponent of 1, so they can be combined. Does that hint help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does help.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is \( 3a^2 + 2a \). Would you like to try another problem?

### **Problem**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \)


#### **Variant 1 (Direct Understanding)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the fractions with the same denominator (\(x\)):  
\[
\frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} = \frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Next, add \(\frac{-2}{x} + \frac{1}{2}\). Rewrite with a common denominator (\(2x\)):  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Yes, I understood.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}

#### **Variant 2 (Clarification Needed for Addition/Subtraction)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the fractions with the same denominator (\(x\)):  
\[
\frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} = \frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Next, add \(\frac{-2}{x} + \frac{1}{2}\). Rewrite with a common denominator (\(2x\)):  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Why do we need a common denominator?  
**System**: Good question! To add or subtract fractions, they must have the same denominator. In this case, we rewrite the fractions with the LCD (\(2x\)) so we can combine them. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}

#### **Variant 3 (Teaching through Analogy)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Let’s break it down step by step. First, think of fractions with the same denominator as items in a group. For example, \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} \) is like having 5 apples and taking away 7 apples. You’re left with \(-2\) apples, or:  
\[
\frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Now, to add \(\frac{-2}{x}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\), we need a common denominator. Imagine you’re combining two groups of items in baskets of different sizes—you need to make the baskets the same size. The LCD here is \(2x\):  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Does that analogy help?

#### **Variant 4 (Nonlinear Flow)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the fractions with the same denominator (\(x\)):  
\[
\frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} = \frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Next, add \(\frac{-2}{x} + \frac{1}{2}\). Rewrite with a common denominator (\(2x\)):  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Can you explain why we use \(2x\) as the common denominator?  
**System**: Sure! To combine fractions, we need a common denominator. The LCD must be a multiple of both denominators. Since one denominator is \(x\) and the other is \(2\), their LCD is \(2x\). Does that make sense now?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}

#### **Variant 5 (Student Suggests an Incorrect Step)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the fractions with the same denominator (\(x\)):  
\[
\frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} = \frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Next, add \(\frac{-2}{x} + \frac{1}{2}\). Rewrite with a common denominator (\(2x\)):  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
The simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Do you understand this step?  
**Student**: Shouldn’t we just add the numerators directly?  
**System**: Not quite! To add fractions, we need a common denominator first. Without it, the operation is invalid. That’s why we rewrite the fractions with the LCD (\(2x\)) before adding. Does that make sense?  
**Student**: Oh, I see now.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]

#### **Variant 6 (Request for Hint)**

**Student**: Simplify \( \frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} + \frac{1}{2} \).  
**System**: Combine like terms. First, combine the fractions with the same denominator (\(x\)):  
\[
\frac{5}{x} - \frac{7}{x} = \frac{-2}{x}
\]  
Now, add \(\frac{-2}{x} + \frac{1}{2}\). Do you know how to combine these fractions?  
**Student**: Not sure, can I get a hint?  
**System**: Sure! Look for a common denominator. The denominators are \(x\) and \(2\), so the least common denominator (LCD) is \(2x\). Rewrite the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-2}{x} = \frac{-4}{2x}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2x}
\]  
Combine the fractions:  
\[
\frac{-4}{2x} + \frac{x}{2x} = \frac{x - 4}{2x}
\]  
Does that help?  
**Student**: Yes, it does.  
**System**: Great! The final simplified expression is:  
\[
\frac{x - 4}{2x}

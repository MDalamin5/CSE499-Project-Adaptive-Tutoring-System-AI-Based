Explanation of Enhancements:
difficulty: Specifies the complexity of the problem, helping the model contextualize the explanation style for hard problems.
intent: Identifies the purpose of each message, such as whether it is an explanation, confirmation, or feedback request. This helps the model learn varied conversation patterns.
step_type: Categorizes the nature of each step in solving the problem, such as factoring or setting factors to zero. This adds specificity to the interaction.
expected_action: Guides the model on how the student should respond (e.g., confirmation, asking for clarification).
context: Tracks the current problem, next steps, and available hints to maintain continuity across interactions.

Benefits for Training:
Enhanced Variability: The intent and step_type fields provide labels that help the model understand different types of interactions and actions.
Rich Context: Including context ensures the model can handle conversations spanning multiple turns or problems.
Realistic Flow: By simulating expected actions, the model learns to anticipate likely responses and adapt dynamically.

Key Enhancements for Improved Effectiveness:
Dynamic Hinting Mechanism:
Add a separate section for hint levels or alternative explanations based on student responses.
This ensures the model learns how to guide students through multi-level hints when needed.
Tracking Misunderstanding Patterns:
Include fields to log student misunderstandings or errors (e.g., proposing incorrect steps).
This helps the model learn how to identify and address common misconceptions.
Feedback Granularity:
Expand the expected_action field to cover multiple feedback types, like "partial understanding," "complete misunderstanding," or "need alternative explanation."
Timestamp and Duration:
Add timestamps or turn durations to simulate real-time learning, helping the model adapt to varying response times.
Error Correction Steps:
Introduce an error_correction field to explicitly document how errors in student responses are corrected by the system.
Emotion/Engagement Detection:
Include a field like student_emotion to infer or simulate student engagement (e.g., "confused," "frustrated," "confident"). This can make the system more empathetic.
Key Additions in the Enhanced JSON:
hint_levels:
Enables multi-level hinting, improving how the model handles student requests for help.
student_emotion:
Simulates emotional state, training the model to adapt explanations empathetically (e.g., offering encouragement when the student seems frustrated).
contextual_suggestions:
Provides follow-up suggestions to create continuity in learning, guiding the model to recommend relevant next steps.
error_correction:
Indicates whether an error occurred during the problem-solving process, allowing the model to adapt dynamically when mistakes happen.
expected_action Array:
Supports multiple possible actions (e.g., "confirm understanding," "request hint"), creating a more flexible interaction flow.

On the left-hand side, expand (x - 2)(x + 3): Multiply x by (x + 3) to get x\u00b2 + 3x, and multiply -2 by (x + 3) to get -2x - 6. Combine terms to get x\u00b2 + x - 6. On the right-hand side, expand (x - 7)(x + 7) using the difference of squares formula: (x - 7)(x + 7) = x\u00b2 - 49. The equation now becomes: x\u00b2 + x - 6 = x\u00b2 - 49. Do you understand this step?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! Subtract x\u00b2 from both sides to simplify: x - 6 = -49. Add 6 to both sides: x = -43.

This gives: x\u00b2 + 8x - 2 = x\u00b2 - 3x. Do you understand this step?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nNo. Can you show me another way?\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nSure! Let\u2019s use substitution. Let y = x + 1 and simplify the equation step by step. This method avoids handling all terms at once. Would you like to try that?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, that sounds easier.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nAlright! Substituting y into the equation simplifies it. From there, solve for y and back-substitute to get x. Does that make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I got it now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nFantastic! Using substitution, the solution still gives x = 2/11. Would you like another example?\n<|end|>"

Expanding the terms allows us to simplify the equation and combine like terms. This step is crucial to isolate x. Does that help?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, it does now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! Let\u2019s continue by solving x = 2/11 after simplifying the equation.

Dividing by x would lose one of the possible solutions (x = 0). For quadratic equations, it\u2019s important to factor or simplify carefully. Let\u2019s continue solving step by step. Does that make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I see now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nAwesome! Solving it fully gives x = 2/11. Would you like another example?\n<|end|>"

Expanding (x + 1)\u00b2 gives x\u00b2 + 2x + 1. Then multiply by 2 to get 2x\u00b2 + 4x + 2. Do you follow so far?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I think so.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, expand (x - 2)\u00b2 to get x\u00b2 - 4x + 4. Subtract that from the previous result.

I have a plan like I want to incorporate RAG in my system to make it more robust. and my plan is using RAG I want to solve a problem like I want to teach math concept like as teacher teach the student. How is my plan? I plan my rag dataset will be a good guide of about topics for example like if a student want to learn trigonometry then my rag data will be like
a complete overview of the topics and pre-requisite about this topic like he have knowledge about algebra if student have lack of knowledge of Algebra then first teach algebra concepts wich need to learn Trigonometry. and next, start to teach the Trigonometry. 
in the dataset have complete instructions about this topic and like how a teacher teaches the students in the class. Teacher first discuss why need this topics and ane teacher teach formula and formula related math problem to more clear about this formula. and necessary technique like which formula will be more use and way need this topics. like a complete instruction of teaching in the dataset.

and my RAG system, there system prompt like this based on the student query like "I want to learn Trigonometry" then system will be extra all relevant datasets from pdf file and then using that instruction my system will get a guide about how to teach the student and system will start to teach based on context data.

its my plan I do not know its work or not. its my hypothetical thinking. help me to implement this RAG. On things I have enough knowledge about RAG and Memory management, I'll use Lnagchain to implement this system. But in Rag, the most important is the Dataset and Rag system prompt.

so help me. i know you have more batter plan. also, tell me that plan, and if you think my plan is not working, then tell me the way how I prepare my dataset because the dataset is the most important I guess.

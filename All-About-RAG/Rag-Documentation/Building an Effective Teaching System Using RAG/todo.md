# Teaching System Enhancement Plan

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Analyze existing RAG system (app.py)
- [x] Examine educational content files (Algebra.md, Geometry.md, Trigonometry.md, functin-graph.md)
- [x] Review pasted_content.txt for additional context

## Design Phase
- [x] Design improved chunking strategy for math educational content
- [x] Develop enhanced teacher simulation prompts
- [x] Plan system improvements for better classroom teaching simulation

## Implementation Phase
- [x] Implement improved chunking mechanism
- [x] Update system and user prompts
- [x] Enhance retrieval mechanism
- [x] Implement teaching flow management

## Documentation Phase
- [x] Document chunking strategy
- [x] Document prompt engineering approach
- [x] Create system architecture documentation
- [x] Provide usage instructions

## Testing Phase
- [x] Test system with sample math questions
- [x] Evaluate teaching effectiveness

## Delivery Phase
- [x] Present final solution
- [x] Provide all code and documentation files

        "text": "<|system|>\nYou are a helpful tutor for solving algebra.\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nSolve the equation: (x + 1)(x + 4) = (x - 7)(x + 6).\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nFirst, expand both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side, multiply ( (x + 1)(x + 4) ): ( x * x = x\u00b2 ), ( x * 4 = 4x ), ( 1 * x = x ), and ( 1 * 4 = 4 ). Adding these together gives ( x\u00b2 + 5x + 4 ). On the right-hand side, multiply ( (x - 7)(x + 6) ): ( x * x = x\u00b2 ), ( x * 6 = 6x ), ( -7 * x = -7x ), and ( -7 * 6 = -42 ). Adding these together gives ( x\u00b2 - x - 42 ). The equation becomes ( x\u00b2 + 5x + 4 = x\u00b2 - x - 42 ). Do you understand this step? (Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nCan you explain the left-hand side expansion again?\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nSure! To expand ( (x + 1)(x + 4) ), use the distributive property: Multiply ( x * x = x\u00b2 ), ( x * 4 = 4x ), ( 1 * x = x ), and ( 1 * 4 = 4 ). Adding these together gives ( x\u00b2 + 5x + 4 ). Does that help?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, that makes sense now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! After expanding both sides, the equation becomes ( x\u00b2 + 5x + 4 = x\u00b2 - x - 42 ). Subtract ( x\u00b2 ) from both sides: ( 5x + 4 = -x - 42 ). Are you ready to proceed?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I\u2019m following now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, add ( x ) to both sides: ( 6x + 4 = -42 ). Subtract 4: ( 6x = -46 ). Finally, divide by 6: ( x = -\frac{46}{6} = -\frac{23}{3} ). Does this solution make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, it does now. Thank you for clarifying!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nYou\u2019re welcome! The solution is ( x = -\frac{23}{3} ). Great effort! Let me know if you\u2019d like to try another equation.\n<|end|>"

(Yes/No/Explain More)\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nI think we should divide both sides by ( x\u00b2 ).\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nThat\u2019s an interesting idea! However, dividing by ( x\u00b2 ) would complicate the equation unnecessarily. Instead, we can subtract ( x\u00b2 ) from both sides to simplify. Let\u2019s try that. Does this make sense?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nOh, I see now. Let\u2019s proceed with subtracting.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nGreat! After subtracting ( x\u00b2 ), the equation becomes ( 5x + 4 = -x - 42 ). Add ( x ) to both sides: ( 6x + 4 = -42 ). Are you following this part?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, I\u2019m following now.\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nNext, subtract 4 from both sides: ( 6x = -46 ). Divide by 6: ( x = -\frac{46}{6} = -\frac{23}{3} ). Does this solution make sense now?\n<|end|>\n\n<|user|>\nYes, it does. Thanks for correcting me!\n<|end|>\n\n<|assistant|>\nYou\u2019re welcome!

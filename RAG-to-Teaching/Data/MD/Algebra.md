# Algebra Instructional Dataset (For AI Math Tutor)

## 🧠 Prerequisites
- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Understanding of numbers: integers, fractions, decimals
- Understanding of mathematical operations and order of operations (PEMDAS)

## 🎯 Why Learn Algebra?
Algebra helps you solve problems where numbers are unknown. It’s used in computer science, engineering, economics, and everyday problem-solving. For example, calculating the total cost of groceries, analyzing phone bills, or determining how long a trip will take.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. **Variables and Constants**
- Variable: A symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value.
- Constant: A fixed value (e.g., 3, -7, 2.5).

### 2. **Expressions**
- Combination of variables, constants, and operators (e.g., `3x + 2`, `a² - 5a + 6`).
- You cannot "solve" an expression, but you can simplify or evaluate it.

### 3. **Equations**
- Equation: A statement that two expressions are equal (e.g., `2x + 3 = 9`).
- Solving an equation means finding the value of the variable(s) that make the equation true.

### 4. **Linear Equations**
- Form: `ax + b = 0`
- Example: `2x + 4 = 10` → `x = 3`
- Graph: A straight line

### 5. **Quadratic Equations**
- Form: `ax² + bx + c = 0`
- Solving methods:
  - Factoring
  - Quadratic Formula
  - Completing the square

### 6. **Factorization**
- Rewriting an expression as a product of its factors
- Example: `x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)`

## 👨‍🏫 Teaching Flow (AI System Prompt Guide)

### Step 1: Connect to Student
> "Let's explore Algebra together! It's like solving puzzles using math. First, let me check — do you understand what a variable is?"

### Step 2: Explain with Examples
> "Think of `x` as a box that hides a number. If I say `x + 3 = 5`, we’re asking: 'What number plus 3 gives 5?' The answer is 2. So, `x = 2`."

### Step 3: Explore Expressions
> "Can you simplify the expression `3x + 2x`? Yes, it becomes `5x` because you're adding like terms."

### Step 4: Solve Equations Step-by-Step
> "Let's solve `2x + 4 = 10`:
> 1. Subtract 4 from both sides → `2x = 6`
> 2. Divide both sides by 2 → `x = 3`"

### Step 5: Practice Factorization
> "Try factoring `x² + 7x + 10`. Which two numbers multiply to 10 and add to 7?"

### Step 6: Apply Quadratic Formula
> "For any equation in form `ax² + bx + c = 0`, use this formula:
>
> \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

### Step 7: Real-Life Application
> "You earn $10 per hour. If you want to earn $150, how many hours must you work? Set up an equation: `10x = 150`. What’s `x`?"

## ❗ Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation
- Mixing up signs (especially during subtraction and multiplication)
- Incorrectly simplifying expressions (e.g., `3x + 2` ≠ `5x`)
- Factoring errors (e.g., wrong pair of factors)

---

## 🔑 Tips and Strategies
- Always isolate the variable
- Check your solution by plugging it back into the equation
- Use the discriminant `b² - 4ac` to determine the nature of quadratic roots
- Practice mental math and simple operations

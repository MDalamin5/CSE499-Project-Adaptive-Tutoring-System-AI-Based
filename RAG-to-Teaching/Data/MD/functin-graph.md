# 📘 Functions and Graphs - Teaching Dataset

## 🧠 Prerequisite Knowledge
- Understanding of variables and expressions
- Basic algebraic manipulation (solving linear equations)
- Familiarity with coordinate system (conceptual only)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what a function is
- Learn how to determine domain and range
- Recognize types of functions (linear, quadratic, etc.)
- Learn function notation and evaluation
- Understand increasing/decreasing behavior

---

## 📌 Topic Breakdown

### 1. 🔍 What is a Function?
A function is a rule that assigns **each input** exactly **one output**.

Example:
If \( f(x) = x + 3 \), then:
- \( f(2) = 5 \)
- \( f(-1) = 2 \)

**Explain:** Think of a function as a machine: You put in a number (input), it performs a rule, and gives back an output.

---

### 2. ✍️ Function Notation
- \( f(x) \) is read as "f of x"
- It means the function f with input x

Example:
If \( f(x) = 2x - 4 \), then:
- \( f(3) = 2(3) - 4 = 2 \)
- \( f(-1) = 2(-1) - 4 = -6 \)

---

### 3. 🌐 Domain and Range
- **Domain:** All valid inputs (x-values)
- **Range:** All possible outputs (f(x)-values)

Example:
For \( f(x) = x^2 \):
- Domain: All real numbers
- Range: \( f(x) \geq 0 \)

---

### 4. 🧱 Types of Functions

#### 🔹 Linear Functions
Form: \( f(x) = mx + b \)
- Straight line
- Constant rate of change (slope = m)

Example: \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \)

#### 🔹 Quadratic Functions
Form: \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \)
- Parabolic shape (U-shaped curve)
- Has vertex and axis of symmetry

Example: \( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \)

#### 🔹 Constant Functions
Form: \( f(x) = c \)
- Always returns same output

---

### 5. 📈 Increasing vs Decreasing
- A function is **increasing** when the output rises as x increases.
- A function is **decreasing** when the output drops as x increases.

Example:
- \( f(x) = x^2 \) is decreasing on \( (-\infty, 0] \) and increasing on \( [0, \infty) \)

---

### 6. 🛠️ Practice Problems (With Steps)

**Q1:** Evaluate \( f(x) = 3x - 2 \) at \( x = 4 \)  
**Answer:** \( f(4) = 3(4) - 2 = 10 \)

**Q2:** What is the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2} \)?  
**Answer:** All real numbers except \( x = 2 \)

**Q3:** Identify type: \( f(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 2 \)  
**Answer:** Quadratic Function

**Q4:** Is \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) increasing or decreasing?  
**Answer:** Increasing (positive slope)

## 🎓 Teaching Strategy
- Begin by explaining functions as real-world input-output machines
- Use lots of everyday examples: vending machines, formulas, apps
- Break into segments: input/output, notation, domain/range
- Relate to previous algebra skills
- Reinforce with small concept-check questions

---

## 📚 Real-Life Applications
- Cost functions in economics (e.g., total cost = fixed + variable)
- Converting temperature (°F = 1.8 × °C + 32)
- Predictive models in statistics

## Trigonometry: Full Instructional Guide

### 1. Introduction to Trigonometry
**Objective**: Understand what trigonometry is and why it’s important.

Trigonometry is the study of relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It plays a crucial role in fields like architecture, engineering, astronomy, and physics.

### 2. Prerequisites
Before diving into trigonometry, students should be comfortable with:
- Algebra (equation solving, manipulating expressions)
- Geometry (properties of triangles, Pythagorean theorem)
- Basic arithmetic and number operations

### 3. Real-Life Applications
- Measuring the height of a building without climbing it
- Calculating distances in astronomy
- Analyzing waves and oscillations

### 4. Key Terms and Definitions
- **Angle**: Formed by two rays with a common endpoint
- **Right Triangle**: A triangle with one 90° angle
- **Hypotenuse**: The side opposite the right angle in a right triangle
- **Opposite side**: The side opposite a given angle
- **Adjacent side**: The side next to a given angle (not the hypotenuse)

### 5. Trigonometric Ratios
These are defined for a right-angled triangle:
- **Sine (sin)** = Opposite / Hypotenuse
- **Cosine (cos)** = Adjacent / Hypotenuse
- **Tangent (tan)** = Opposite / Adjacent

### 6. Teaching Sequence
#### Step 1: Labeling Triangle Sides
Use a right triangle diagram and help students label the hypotenuse, opposite, and adjacent sides based on a given angle.

#### Step 2: Introducing Trigonometric Ratios
Explain and write down the three basic ratios using the labeled triangle. Use the acronym SOH-CAH-TOA for memory aid.

#### Step 3: Practice Problems
Example:
- If the opposite side is 3 cm and the hypotenuse is 5 cm, what is sin(θ)?
- sin(θ) = 3/5 = 0.6

#### Step 4: Using a Calculator
Show students how to calculate sine, cosine, and tangent values using a calculator. Emphasize checking whether the calculator is in degree or radian mode.

#### Step 5: Solving Triangles
Guide students to find unknown angles and sides using trigonometric ratios.

### 7. The Unit Circle
Introduce the unit circle as a way to extend trigonometry beyond right triangles. Cover:
- Definition (circle with radius 1 centered at origin)
- Coordinates representing cos(θ) and sin(θ)
- Special angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°)

### 8. Common Mistakes to Address
- Confusing opposite and adjacent sides
- Forgetting to check calculator mode
- Using degrees instead of radians or vice versa

### 9. Practice Set (Basic Level)
1. In a right triangle, if the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent is 3, find tan(θ).
2. Given sin(θ) = 0.8, find the angle θ (use calculator).
3. Find the hypotenuse if the opposite side is 5 and sin(θ) = 0.6.

### 10. Advanced Topics (for Extension)
- Trigonometric Identities
- Graphs of sine, cosine, and tangent functions
- Inverse trigonometric functions
- Solving real-world problems using trigonometry

### 11. Review & Recap
- Create a summary diagram showing SOH-CAH-TOA
- Provide a mini quiz
- Encourage group problem-solving activities

### 12. Transition Topics
After mastering Trigonometry, students should move on to:
- Trigonometric identities
- Coordinate geometry
- Vectors and forces

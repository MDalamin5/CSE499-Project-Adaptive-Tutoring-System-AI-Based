# Enhanced Math Teaching RAG System: Final Solution

## Project Overview

This project has enhanced a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system into a sophisticated teaching tool that simulates how teachers teach mathematics in a high school classroom. The system provides students with interactive, pedagogically sound instruction across various math topics including Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Function Graphs.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Semantic Chunking Strategy

We've replaced the basic character-based chunking with a semantic chunking approach that preserves the pedagogical structure of math instruction:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Content is organized into topic-level, concept-level, application-level, and meta-information chunks
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Each chunk includes educational metadata (topic, concept, difficulty level, etc.)
- **Cross-Reference System**: Chunks maintain connections to prerequisites and related content
- **Pedagogical Coherence**: Teaching flow and context are preserved within chunks

### 2. Teacher Simulation Prompts

We've developed a multi-layered prompt architecture to guide the LLM in simulating classroom teaching:

- **Base Teacher Identity**: Establishes the AI's role as an experienced math teacher
- **Pedagogical Approach**: Defines teaching methodologies and strategies
- **Content Adaptation**: Guides transformation of formal content into teaching language
- **Interaction Pattern**: Structures the teaching conversation flow
- **Assessment & Feedback**: Guides checking for understanding and providing feedback
- **Topic-Specific Guidance**: Specialized prompts for Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Functions

### 3. Enhanced Retrieval Mechanism

The retrieval system has been improved to:

- Use metadata for more relevant retrievals
- Consider prerequisite relationships
- Retrieve both content and teaching strategies
- Prioritize pedagogically appropriate chunks

### 4. Teaching Flow Management

The system now maintains a coherent teaching flow by:

- Tracking the teaching state across interactions
- Adapting to student questions and responses
- Ensuring progressive skill development
- Simulating classroom dialogue patterns
